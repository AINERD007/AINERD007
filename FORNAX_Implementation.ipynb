The first edition of the DDC was published in 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editions will continue to appear as needed.  In spite of the DDC's long and healthy life, however, its full story has never been told.  There have been biographies of Dewey that briefly describe his system, but this is the first attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that more than any other has spurred the growth of librarianship in this country and abroad. \", '2': 'Use Made of Technical Libraries Slater, M. This report is an analysis of 6300 acts of use in 104 technical libraries in the United Kingdom. Library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern of information use.  Information transfer in libraries is restricted to the use of documents.  It takes no account of documents used outside the library, still less of information transferred orally from person to person.  The library acts as a channel in only a proportion of the situations in which information is transferred. Taking technical information transfer as a whole, there is no doubt that this proportion is not the major one.  There are users of technical information - particularly in technology rather than science - who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on desk collections of handbooks, current periodicals and personal contact with their colleagues and with people in other organizations.  Even regular library users also receive information in other ways. ', '3': \"Two Kinds of Power An Essay on Bibliographic Control Wilson, P. The relationships between the organization and control of writings and the organization and control of knowledge and information will inevitably enter our story, for writings contain, along with much else, a great deal of mankind's stock of knowledge and information.  Bibliographical control is a form of power, and if knowledge itself is a form of power, as the familiar slogan claims, bibliographical control is in a certain sense power over power, power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written form.  As writings are not simply, and not in any simple way, storehouses of knowledge, we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control as simply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings. \", '4': \"Systems Analysis of a University Library; final report and research project Buckland, M.K. The establishment of nine new universities in the 1960's provoked a highly stimulating re-examination of the nature, purpose and management of academic libraries.  Long-established attitudes and methods were questioned, but although changes were made, the basic difficulty remained - a lack of objective information about the best ways of providing a library service in a university. The report of the UGC Committee on Libraries (the Parry Repot [267]), which, in general, endorsed these changes, also stressed the need for research into all aspects of academic library provision. \", '5': 'A Library Management Game: a report on a research project Brophy, P. Although the use of games in professional education has become widespread only during the last decade, the method has been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years. Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in military training when the \"real thing\" was either unavailable or too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games have become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved. Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education, from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional men and women.  One of the main causes of this \"game explosion\" has been the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology. ', '6': 'Abstracting Concepts and Methods Borko, H. Graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a how-to-do-it course. It should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts, the historical development of abstracting publications, the abstract-publishing industry (especially in the United States), and the need for standards in the preparation and evaluation of the product. These topics we call concepts. The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing various types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications. These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the appendix. There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications. Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the past. Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship. Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of computer-prepared abstracts and extracts. Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text, select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts. The benefits of this research are discussed. Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry. Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or volunteer workers. Many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they know they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information. One chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors. ', '7': 'Academic Library Buildings A Guide to Architectural Issues and Solutions Ellsworth, R.E. This book attempts to present representative examples of successful architectural solutions to the important problems librarians and architects face in planning new college and university library buildings or in remodeling and enlarging existing structures.  It does not attempt to make case study evaluations, as was done by Ellsworth Mason for Brown and Yale.  Nor does it present examples of unsuccessful solutions except to show how to avoid mistakes, and in these cases the libraries will not be identified. ', '8': 'The Academic Library Essays in Honor of Guy R. Lyle Farber, E.I. As important for staff members\\' individual development as was the apprenticeship in administration, perhaps the most significant attitude one acquired while working for Guy was engendered by his insistence that librarians must be interested in and knowledgeable about the content of the materials with which they dealt.  His love of literature, his respect for scholarship, his admiration for good writing and reading were manifested in many ways, but most notably in his admonition that, though we were primarily a research library, we must constantly keep in mind our obligation to collect contemporary poetry, fiction and belles-letters.  It was primarily up to the library staff, he felt, to be responsible for these as well as for \"general\" books which crossed disciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines, those books which a faculty mostly concerned with research materials is apt to overlook.  And in building this portion of the collection, \"there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance with books through a reading of critical reviews and the books themselves.\"  This counsel is from The President, the Professor, and the College Library, but the importance of its thrust--the need to keep up with the world of books and publishing--was continually impressed upon us. ', '9': 'Access to Libraries in College Hyman, R.T. This study assumed that an additional use study held less promise than an analytical consideration of concepts. The basic approach was a survey comparing traditional and current professional ideas on direct access.  Principal data-gathering instruments were documentary analysis and opinion questionnaire. Findings of the documentary analysis included the following: Research from 1890 to 1970 on the direct shelf approach and browsing left the problems largely unresolved and evidently resistant to established methods of use and user research.  The need for an exhaustive study of concepts was confirmed. Open shelf libraries--organized through shelf classification and relative location--were meant to arouse the intellectual, social, and political interest of the average citizen and affect his democratic self-realization. Definitions of \"browsing\" varied greatly: self-indulgence by the untutored in objectionable works; beneficial self-education for the general reader; valuable guidance for the scholar in his research. ', '10': 'Access to Periodical Resources Palmour, V.E. The purpose of this study was to develop, evaluate, and recommend a national plan  for improving access to periodical resources.  About 48 percent of all academic interlibrary loans are for periodical materials, with the bulk of the loans being satisfied in the form of photocopies.  A major consideration in the long-range improvement of the interlibrary loan system is the possible augmentation with a national system for acquiring, storing, and satisfying loan requests for periodical materials. This study focused on the physical access to the periodical literature.  Based on the needs of the library community, design features were developed, and included the following: Service should be made available to all users without any restriction other than access through a library. Initially, the service should be confined primarily to rapid, dependable delivery of photocopies of journal articles. The collection of a center should be comprehensive in subject coverage excluding only medicine. All worthwhile journals should be collected irrespective of language. ', '11': 'The Acquisition of Library Materials Ford, S. The scope of acquisitions work, outlined in the Introduction, acknowledges the importance of selection policy, serials recording, and other topics kindred to acquisitions. These topics are discussed in this book only as they relate to obtaining library materials.  They are examined thoroughly in books and papers that are cited in the references and the bibliographic note. Centralized acquisitions and automation of order routines are of major importance in order work and they are reviewed as chapters in this book.  These chapters are introductions to the concepts and problems of centralization and automation, not manuals of practice. For treatment of these topics in particular and in depth the reader is referred to the references cited.  For automation these references are only a modest selection from an enormous literature. ', '12': \"Acquisition from the 3rd World Clarke, D.A. The Ligue des bibliotheques europeennes de recherche (LIBER) was set up in 1971 as an international non-governmental organization, with the aim of establishing close collaboration between the general research libraries of Western Europe, particularly national and university libraries, and in particular to help in finding practical ways of improving the quality of the services these libraries provide. At the second meeting of its General Assembly, held in Luxembourg in 1972, LIBER decided to hold a seminar on the acquisition of materials from the 'Third World'; and I was charged with the 'intellectual organization' of this seminar.  The purpose of the meeting would be to examine the problems of acquisition; the availability of materials in European libraries both for reference and for lending; and the feasibility of setting up a European centre for the collection of such material, to be available for loan.  The provision of bibliographic information, preferable in machine-readable form, was to be a basic consideration, whatever means were proposed for acquiring publications from those areas.  The Council of Europe made a generous grant towards the cost of the seminar which was held at the University of Sussex from 17 to 19 September 1973. \", '13': 'AD695049 Wooster, H.

If this book has a central thesis, it rests upon the simple but frequently neglected principle that college library service goes beyond the commonly accepted functions of book circulation and storage.  The college library exists, not merely to house and circulate library materials, but to supplement and extend the teaching process with reference service, to afford faculty members library opportunities for improving instruction, and to encourage students to read more and better books.  Administration is essentially a service activity, a tool through which library functions are more fully and efficiently realized. The present work retains most of the material of the first edition, but includes substantial revision in each chapter.  The book was planned not only as a text in the teaching of college library administration but also for independent professional reading.  Because readers have found the footnotes and chapter bibliographies useful for reference purposes, they have been brought up to date and in some cases extended.

The structure of technical communication networks in the two laboratories results from the interaction of both social relations and work structure..

This manual is designed to make it possible for any library to change efficiently to the Library of Congress Classification system.  Detailed procedures are outlined which may serve as exact models or as a series of suggested steps which have proven effective in actual use.  Most of the text deals with the necessary criteria for effecting the planning, making the preparations, selecting the tools, and establishing the procedures which are essential for a reclassification project.  Beyond this, considerable attention has been given to many of the problem areas of the LC Classification-series, biography, bibliography, law, PZ3 and PZ4.  In addition, the literature Tables VIIIa and IXa, two of the most frequently used tables throughout the entire class system, have been thoroughly explained and their application illustrated by a series of comprehensive examples.  Since the mechanics, production, and cost of catalogue card copy can significantly affect the flow of books to users, a chapter has been devoted to describing the use of Xerox copying machines in library operations.  Finally, an annotated bibliography of books and articles judged to be helpful in deciding to reclassify is included for those readers who wish to delve more deeply into the tortuous and frustrating 50-year history of the concept of centralized cataloging and classification.  The numbers enclosed in parentheses throughout the text refer to sources in the bibliography which relate to or support the arguments being advanced in any particular case.

Advances in Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need.  It will present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature, research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types. Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all librarians who can visualize its potential. Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series. As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts expected. Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope to get there. \"The Machine and Cataloging\" reviews the current status of the machine-produced book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC. Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as reported in \"Mechanization of Acquisition Processes.\" Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the future, not the past. One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in \"Filing Systems for Computer Manipulation.\" This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions. For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts. As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential. The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years. The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the instructional media center. Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library. Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception. Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow. Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries. The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some. The article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world. ', '18': 'Selective Dissemination of Information Mauerhoff, G.R. 1974 The present contribution does not duplicate previous studies but complements the earlier publications and closes the few gaps that exist in the literature prior to 1966 and after 1971.  Additionally, it is a bold attempt to evaluate critically and objectively the history of the mechanized selective dissemination of information (SDI) as reflected in the literature, from the initial description by Luhn (1958, 1961b, c) to the post-1970 period when the SDI boom began losing ground to the more popular on-line interactive systems.  The review therefore questions and interprets the concept of SDI, its implementation, and its evolution in the light of work performed by many companies, government agencies, universities, societies, and libraries during the last fourteen years. ', '19': 'Adventures in Theory of Languages Herdan, G. In trying to give an account of the statistical properties of language, one is faced with the problem of having to find the common thread which would show the many and multifarious forms of language statistics - embodied in scattered papers written by linguists, philosophers, mathematicians, engineers, each using his own professional idiom as belonging to one great whole: quantitative linguistics. The book stresses the peculiarity of statistics of language structure as against just conventional statistics.  To put the difference between two types of statistics briefly, the latter comprises the methods and parameters of general number statistics as applied, e.g., in Economics and Demography, the former has its own methods and characterising parameters, particularly useful for describing and evaluating language structure.  The idea of statistical linguistics as using concepts and methods of its own, which was adumbrated in the author\\'s \"Language as choice and Chance\", 1956, has now taken definite shape. Of this development I shall try to give a brief account.  In my book, \"Language as Choice and Chance\", the foundation was laid for a truly sensible application of statistics to language by my interpretation of the langue-parole dichotomy as being essentially that between statistical universe and sample. ', '20': 'The Age of Jewett: Charles Coffin Jewett and American Librarianship 1841-1868 Harris, M.M. Most librarians mark the beginning of modern librarianship from the founding of the American Library Association in 1876 and the appearance on the national library scene of such dynamic and controversial figures as Melvil Dewey and Charles Ammi Cutter. But in doing so, they overlook an extremely significant era in the history of our profession, for the quarter century preceding the 1876 meeting in Philadelphia was one characterized by great advances in the field of American librarianship.  This period of growth was to have considerable influence on the course of library development in America after 1876.  To ignore the third quarter of the nineteenth century is to risk misinterpreting the pivotal post-1876 era, and in this time of reappraisal, it seems particularly appropriate and useful to focus our attention on the years preceding the founding of the American Library Association. ', '21': 'On Aggression Lorenz, K. In this book, Lorenz deals with the evolution of aggression in vertebrates.  He points out that aggressivity is totally different from predation: that it is a biological necessity for defence of territory and for a cornered animal, and that it becomes mixed up with other innate drives, thus leading up towards reduction of intraspecific damage. This, be it noted, is most evident in fiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the pack is virtually impossible and where co-operation without fighting is necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbially peaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and often fatal attacks on the weaker mate. In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how in the human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, and not guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, the aggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels. Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior, many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found in animals.  In any event, On Aggression is a fascinating book by a master of his subject. ', '22': 'Education and Manpower for Librarians Asheim, L.E. This paper is not an official policy statement of the American Library Association nor of the Office for Library Education.  It is simply an exploration, an outline of possibilities for consideration by the profession.  Its purpose is to generate discussion that will lead eventually to a statement of Association policy that the profession will support and make effective. A basic assumption on which the statement rests is this: that the library occupation is much broader than that segment of it which is the library profession, but that the professional segment has responsibility for the definition and supervision of the training and education required by the complete range of activities encompassed by the occupation.  Librarians are not the only persons who work in libraries, but librarians are the ones who are concerned with the advancement and improvement of the library profession.  It follows then that it is the obligation of the professionals to engage actively in the establishment and maintenance of standards and norms governing the preparation of people who work at any level in libraries.  They should define and guide the kinds of preparation most useful at the pre-professional level and not merely the education of those who will hold positions at the level we now call \"professional.\" ', '23': 'Pilot Inventory of Library Holdings Braden, I.A. This project was undertaken because of the high degree of uncertainty among the library staff regarding the extent of the problem of missing books.  The findings of this study gave the Ohio State University libraries concrete evidence as to how many books are missing and indicated the areas in which book losses are the greatest.  These figures also provide information which can be conveyed to the faculty or administration when they voice complaints about the unavailability of library books.  The areas where losses are high also tend to indicate the areas of most frequent use. ', '24': 'Libraries and Technological Forces Affecting Them Cuadra, C.A. 1.

What, if anything, should we do tomorrow to try to get from here to here? ', '25': \"Algebraic Systems Maltsev, A.I. As far back as the 1920's, algebra had been accepted as the science studying the properties of sets on which there is defined a particular system of operations.  However up until the forties the overwhelming majority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraic structures.  These were primarily groups, rings and lattices.  The first general theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitrary operations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935).  During these same years, A. Tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basic principles of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations.  Such sets are now called models.  In contrast to algebra, model theory made abundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic.  The possibility of making fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras but also the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory was discovered by the author in 1936. During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that the theory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimately related despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems.  And it is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systems dealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations and relations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is the language of the so-called applied predicate calculus.  Thus the theory can be considered to border on logic and algebra. \", '26': 'Indexing and Abstracting by Association Doyle, L.B. This article discusses the possibility of exploiting the statistics of word co-occurrence in text for purposes of document retrieval. Co-occurrence is defined and related to the mental processes of authors and readers; several means of quantitative measurement of word co-occurrence are then scrutinized.  It is shown that the most strongly co-occurring word pairs, which are therefore \"associated\" in a statistical sense, can be represented in the form of an \"association map.\"  The last half of the article presents two modes of use of association maps in literature searching. ', '27': 'Cost Analysis and Simulation Procedures for the Evaluation of Large Information Systems Bourne, C.P. Ford, D.F. A computer program has been written and used which simulates the several-year operation of an information system and computes estimates of the expected operating costs as well as the amount of equipment and personnel required during that time period.  The program has been used for the analysis of several large systems and has proven itself to be a useful research tool for the study of systems with so many components and interrelated operations that an equivalent manual analysis would be extremely cumbersome and time consuming,and perhaps even impractical. This paper describes this program and shows, as an example, some of the results of a simulation of two of several suggested designs for a specific information system. ', '28': 'A Note on the Pseudo-Mathematics of Relevance Taube, M. Recently a number of articles, books, and reports dealing with information systems, i.e., document retrieval systems, have advanced the doctrine that such systems are to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage of relevancy they provide. Although there seems to be little agreement on what relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable, there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed and formal relationship exists between the relevance and the recall performance of any system.  Thus, we will find in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of relevance as reported by individual users, and equations, curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide numerical measures of the recall and relevance characteristics of information systems.  This phenomenon of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective and non-mathematical term to equations in which the same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical definition has its ancient parallel in discussions of probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate the meaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out, on \"who is master,\" the user or the term.  On the other hand, the use of a single term in the same document to cover two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does not have, represents a more serious situation than merely careless ambiguity. ', '29': 'Some Questions Concerning \"Information Need\" O\\'Connor, J. The expression \"satisfying a requester\\'s information need\" is often used, but its meaning is obscure.  The literature on \"information need\" in relation to retrieval suggests three different (though not inconsistent) possible interpretations.  However, each of these interpretations is itself fundamentally unclear. The various obscurities involved are indicated by critical questions, which those who write of information need are invited to answer.

This is an interim report on continuing studies of library operations at Massachusetts Institute of Technology being made by members of the Institute's Operations Research Project in cooperation with the librarians and library staff.  In this report, which is based on actual observations of on-the-premise use made of the Science Library, various statistics measuring the kind, degree, and intensity of use are tabulated.  In addition there are some suggested measures of effectiveness of the library. A unique outcome of the survey has been the construction and verification of a mathematical model employing probability theory to measure rate and kind of use of library material together with length of stay of library patrons. Such models, characteristic of an operations research approach, give promise of furthering the goal of effective library management and planning. \", '32': 'Information Gathering Patterns and Creativity A study of research chemists in an industrial research laboratory Maizell, Robert E. A comparison of creative and \"noncreative\" research chemists with respect to the ways in which they use their professional and technical literature.. The creative chemists differ from the \"noncreative\" in that the former read more technical literature on the job, are less reluctant to use literature of greater reading difficulty, are less influenced in their independence of thought, read more extensively and consult more frequently the older material, are more inquisitive and have broader cultural interests.. The findings of the study are believed to be helpful in planning library and information services, in refining future inquiries into the ways in which scientists use recorded information, and in improving tests for the identification of creative ability among chemists..

Analysis of the problems of defining the mutual relevancies of queries and document-collections indicates that they essentially involve the problem of conceptual relatedness.. In order to consider the later problem, the question of concept-formation is first discussed, which in turn requires a definition of concept.. An extensional interpretation is suggested whereby a concept is associated with a class of conceptually-similar documents.. Users' similarity- judgments then provide the empirical data for formal definitions of concept and conceptual relatedness.. It is found, however, that certain very general difficulties rule out the possibility of defining concepts and their relatedness by the method proposed.. Since this method is based on human relevance-judgments, it seems a natural one to adopt, so that its collapse has serious practical and theoretical consequences.. An alternative approach is therefore proposed whose elaboration will form Part II of this article.. \", '43': 'The Consistency of Human Judgments of Relevance Resnick, A. Savage, T.R. A comparison of the ability of humans to consistently judge the relevance of documents to their general interests from bases of citations, abstracts, keywords, and total text was made under controlled experimental conditions..

The strategy outlined in this article describes a possible aid to the librarian for thinning a library's stack according to the criterion of user needs.. The method uses the last circulation date as a parameter of user circulation requirements.. The resulting stack collection would, by design, satisfy over 99 percent of the user circulation requirements and yet be of minimum size.. Preliminary, but not yet fully validated research, indicates that the number of volumes in a library's holdings may be reduced by 60 to 70 percent and yet satisfy well over 99 percent of the user requirements.. It may also be possible to determine which books should have multiple copies in order that user disappointment can be minimized..

Means of providing this selectivity are discussed.. Particular attention is given to the possibility of adding short codes to the citation entries which would be informative of the way in which the citing publication is operationally related to the cited one (this method is an integral feature of the Shepard's legal citations).. A scheme of citation relationships of potential value to users of science literature is presented.. These relationships were tested on a sampling of physics literature.. The suggested categories include indicators of the relation of the citing reference to the scientific process in general, as well as indicators of its relationship to the cited reference in particular..

The average author set contained almost half of all the terms employed by more than one member of the user group and scored 73% of the maximal possible score, as compared with 44% for the average title set.. When judged by the method and criterion employed here, author indexing is substantially better than indexing derived from document titles..

The new measure is based on calculations of the expected number of irrelevant documents in the collection which would have to be searched through before the desired number of relevant documents could be found.. Its advantages are: (1) it provides  a single index of the property it attempts to measure; (2) it allows for gradations of retrieval status, through the mathematical concept of a \"weak ordering\"; (3) it evaluates retrieval performance relative to random searching; and (4) it takes into account the amount of relevant material desired by the requester..

A principle of sequential optimization in search theory distributes the search effort at each stage so as to maximize the probability of target detection with the effort expended thus far.. As an application of this principle to the search of pertinent items in a literature file, the file items should be arranged in decreasing order of the probability that an item will yield the information sought.. Complete ordering in this manner may not be feasible, and it is proposed that the files be partially ordered in search zones with some loss in search efficiency.. A model for assessing the relative efficiency for partial ordering is developed and used to determine optimal zone sizes under an assumed target distribution pattern.. In this way, trade-off between file organization effort and search effort can be meaningfully evaluated.. A representative target distribution function for search literature appears to follow the Bradford law of scattering.. This function is used to demonstrate the application of the model over a meaningful range of parameters obtained from empirical studies.. It is shown that a good two-zone search plan to scientific literature is one in which 15-20% of the most useful documents are examined first..

The attempt is to show how the theory of publication pattern (discussed in the earlier article) has been used to produce a different idea in computer control of serials.. Publication pattern information which is entered into the master record for each title causes check-in cards for the next expected issue of each title to be generated by the computer, regardless of when this text issue is expected - next week, next month, next year.. This is departure from most systems, which attempt to predict a certain number of issues which should arrive during a given time period.. The information, which must be a part of the computer record, is described, as are library procedures in maintaining the system..

Questions were collected from eye researchers and a selected group of these were searched in nine different secondary sources.. Articles thought to be relevant were Xeroxed and sent to the eye researchers who subsequently rated the articles.. Articles of eye research interest are found in a wide variety of journals, but a small number of journals carry a large proportion of the articles judged valuable by the eye researchers.. Approximately a fourth of eye research articles are in foreign languages.. Translations are not readily available.. Despite a delay of more than 15 month between the original appearance of article in journals and the mailing of photocopies, about half of the articles of interest to the researchers were not known to them previously.. For extensive retrospective searches more than one secondary service must be used.. Index Medicus and Excerpta Medica (Section 12) or Ophthalmic Literature would be good sources.. MEDLARS demand searches were not shown to be clearly superior to manual searches of Index Medicus.. Titles, abstracts, and full text were shown to be equally effective in permitting searches to retrieve references that were subsequently rated as relevant by the researchers.. A searcher with a background in ophthalmology was able to retrieve more articles of research interest than other non-ophthalmologist searchers..

An aspect of the human use of information that has generally been overlooked in the automation in information services is the human tendency to locate information spatially.. Computer-based systems do not necessarily assign any unique role to spatial tags, and so a feature of considerable importance for the organization of the user's memory seems to have been largely overlooked.. The spatial dimension of human memory is discussed, and some suggestions are offered for exploiting it more effectively in the context of information retrieval services.. \", '67': 'The Use of Simulation in Studying Information Storage and Retrieval Systems Baker, Norman R. Nance, Richard E. Previous applications of simulation to information storage and retrieval systems (ISRS) have been overly restrictive in their scope and have failed to consider the environment within which such systems operate.. This paper considers the ISRS as a subsystem within a larger system which includes the users and the funders of the retrieval system.. The three components form a closed-loop information feedback system in which user response influences both the funding and operation of the ISRS as it attempts to satisfy user needs within a finite budget allocation.. Reward-cost theory provides the basis for describing user behavior.. An industrial dynamics model has been developed to simulate ISRS/user/funder behavior where a university departmental library is the ISRS component..

This paper is concerned with retrieval of documents, in response to a question, from which answers to that question can be inferred (\"answer-providing documents\").. \"Answer can be inferred from document\" has many possible meanings, one of which must be selected (an \"inference specification\").. Inasmuch as scientists in a field disagree about the correctness of inferences, have somewhat different background knowledge, etc., any inference specification can only approximate scientific inference practices.. Two sources of systematic knowledge of document-statement inference practices in a scientific field are described.. (II) If a content word occurs in a question, then it occurs in any answer to that question (with some apparently tractable exceptions).. An indexing procedure based on that fact is described which would permit retrieval of all answer-providing documents for a question.. However, because the indexing is \"nonrelational\", it could cause false retrievals as well.. Various ways of dealing with such false retrievals are   briefly indicated, and a study is sketched that would provide data for helping selection among them.. Two special point concerning indexing for retrieval of answer-providing documents are discussed separately.. ', '69': 'Statistical Generation of a Technical Vocabulary Stone, D. C.

The results of this comparison were fairly clear-cut characterizations in each case of relevant and partially relevant abstracts..

The SMART automatic document retrieval system is used to study association procedures for automatic content analysis.. The effect of word frequency and other parameters on the association process is investigated through examination of related pairs and through retrieval experiments.. Associated pairs of words usually reflect localized word meanings, and true synonyms cannot readily be found from first or second order relationships in our document collections.. There is little overlap between word relationships found through associations and those used in thesaurus construction, and the effects of word associations and a thesaurus in retrieval are independent.. The use of associations in retrieval experiments improves not only recall, by permitting new matches between requests and documents, but also precision, by reinforcing existing matches.. In our experiments, the precision effect is responsible for most of the improvement possible with associations.. A properly constructed thesaurus, however, offers better performance than statistical association methods..

For each pattern, journals were ranked by frequency of use and a scatter diagram was drawn.. Patterns I and II largely resembled patterns obtained by counting citations in basic journals or by counting publications of selected researchers.. Pattern III was more widely scattered..  It is concluded that access to diverse journals is needed by researchers to supply new ideas, and that this diversity of reading is not reflected adequately by citation counting or other indirect means.. Current Contents, used by the author for current-awareness purposes in building his card file, generated 88% of all articles..

When adding a document to a collection, an indexer should choose a representation which makes evident both the content of the document and its relation to other documents already in the collection.. Toward this end, the Negotiated Search Facility (NSF) makes possible indexer-controlled retrieval of information from a collection data base using tools beyond those available in a traditional bibliographic catalog.. The design philosophy of NSF is to offer a framework to guide the indexer while allowing him freedom to retrieve any data which he judges will help him make indexing decisions.. An example which indicates how an indexer might use the facility also shows how the display formats and command language promote interaction..

The method makes use of both the in-document word-occurrence frequency and the in-corpus relative occurrence frequency as measures of word importance.. Each statistical criterion was compared with the performance of human indexers by the use of rank correlation statistics.. The simple word count was found to be superior to the other four previously suggested criteria - all of which made use of the in-corpus relative occurrence frequency..

Experimental data on indexing consistency is presented for certain categories of indexers; and consistency, quality, and exhaustivity values are compared and analyzed..

It is often assumed that the amount of interindexer consistency experienced under a given method of indexing is somehow indicative of the quality of the indexing.. To explore this assumption, two hypotheses are stated concerning the possible connection between interindexer consistency and indexing quality.. A specific counter-example is then exhibited which shows both hypotheses to be invalid.. Although a mathematical analysis of the counterexample yields certain insights, the general relationship between interindexer consistency and successful retrieval is more subtle than might have been expected..

In each case the positive judge was first asked to indicate what answer he inferred, and from what document passage(s).. The further discussion depended on the details of each case.. In general, the resolution procedures used will resolve a disagreement about whether a document is answer-providing or reduce it to a familiar kind of scientific disagreement (about a passage's meaning, a statement's correctness, or an inference's correctness)..

With increasing scientific collaboration, visibility of individual role-performance has diminished.. Ordering of author' names as an adaptive device which symbolizes their relative contributions to research.. Interviews with Nobel laureates and comparisons of their name-order practices to those of other scientists suggest that this symbol is ambiguous and makes evaluation of individual role-performance difficult.. A probability model of expected distribution of name orders is used in measuring preferences for particular sequences, and these preferences vary with the authors' eminence.. On the assumptions that authors' names are listed in order of the value of their contributions, laureates should be first-authors more often than other scientists; in fact, they are not.. Instead, they exercise their noblesse oblige by giving credit to less eminent co-workers increasingly as their eminence grows.. They do so more often after the prize, and eminent laureates-to-be forego first-authorship more often than  those as yet unrecognized..

The Matthew Effect occurs when scientists receive differential recognition for a particular scientific contribution depending on their location in the stratification system.  Merton originally introduced the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of multiple discoveries or collaborators.  In this paper the concept is generalized to apply to all scientific work.  If the Matthew Effect were to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system. To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of similar design.  In each study we control for the number of citations papers received at time 2.  This enables us to look at groups of papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2. We then see whether there were any differences in the reception of these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's location in the stratification system.  All the data indicate that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important determinant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratification variables.  However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery.  The Matthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious points of the social system of science.  All other stratification variables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards did not influence the speed of diffusion.  Data are presented that indicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low- ranking scientists.  The Matthew Effect also serves to focus attention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility of the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame.

In most libraries most users face a complex, monolithic arrangement of entries in catalogs and books on shelves.  In classical librarianship no effort can be made to personalize the listing of titles or arrangement of volumes for an individual user.  A user is unidentified, and, except for that small fraction of a percent who consult reference librarians, users remain nameless. The computer, however, with its superb ability to treat users as individual persons and events as individual events, possesses the potential for enabling big libraries to recapture the human qualities of which classical librarianship has deprived them since their days as one-librarian libraries.  However, rehumanization is not the only contribution computerization will make to libraries. Developments in modern society are forcing libraries to establish new objectives.  Contemporary living is information based, a phenomenon that is outmoding the venerable concept of library function.  As small special libraries already do, all libraries must participate in the cultural activities of the individuals in their communities rather than merely make available a torpid \"service.\" Libraries must look forward to supplying information to a user when and where he needs it - an objective impossible to attain with classical library techniques.

The United States has been engaged in activities known variously as technical assistance, technical cooperation, or development assistance for the past twenty-five years.  This form of foreign aid, either government sponsored or privately supported, is a twentieth century phenomenon.  The broader concept, foreign aid or foreign assistance, means providing another country with any kind of goods, whether financial, commodity, or manpower, to almost any purpose, and extends to antiquity.  Technical assistance, which may be defined, on the other hand, as the supplying of techniques, is an outgrowth of the industrial revolution and parallels America's rise in the nineteenth century to world recognition as an important industrial and trade power.  Government use of such aid as an instrument of foreign policy, as well as the integration of these private and public efforts in the foreign assistance field, began to develop under President Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy.

The recent upsurge of interest in the behavioral aspects of scientific and technical communication and information flow has two distinct sources, a theoretical one in the development of communication research, and a practical one in the concerns of policy makers in scientific organizations and information services. For some time past, the attention of sociologists and social psychologists studying communication processes, once focused on so-called mass phenomena and mass publics, has turned to the interplay of communication processes with more and more definitely delineated and mapped aspects of social structure. One aspect of this shift in interest has been the increasing attention paid by behavioral scientists to the systems supplying information of a specialized sort, and to the publics which are consumers of this specialized information. The scientific and applied professions have been most prominent among the publics so studied. ', '96': 'Communication Patterns in Applied Technology Marquis, D.G. Allen, T.J. The preceding papers have addressed themselves to the study of information flow in a particular stream of human activity which has been variously called science, pure science, basic research, or fundamental research, and which is only secondarily, if at all, concerned with the practical utilization of its products. At this point it is appropriate to note that there is a parallel activity which includes applied research, exploratory development, and engineering development. This second stream of research we will call technology. Far more is known about the flow of information among scientists than among technologists.  From the knowledge that is available, however, we are led to conclude that the communication patterns in the two areas of activity are not only largely independent of one another, but qualitatively different in their nature.  This difference is reflected most clearly in the mechanisms by which information is diffused within the two sets of practitioners.  The present paper is addressed to these differences and to a discussion of the nature of the communication process between science and technology.

We can only guess what historians of the future will say about the condition of present-day sociology.  But it seems safe to anticipate one of their observations. When the Trevelyans of 2050 come to write that history - as they well might, for this clan of historians promises to go on forever - they will doubtless find it strange that so few sociologists (and historians) of the twentieth century could bring themselves, in their work, to treat science as one of the great social institutions of the time.  They will observe that long after the sociology of science became an identifiable field of inquiry, it remained little cultivated in a world where science loomed large enough to present mankind with the choice of destruction or survival.  They may even suggest that somewhere in the process by which social scientists take note of the world as it is and as it once was, a sense of values appears to have become badly scrambled.

In scientific psychology, this occurred in the late nineteenth century in Germany.. Using Germany as a positive case, and France, Britain and the United States as negative cases, it is shown that the new role resulted from academic career opportunities favoring the mobility of practitioners and students of psychology into other fields, and from the relatively low academic standing of speculative philosophy and its consequent receptivity to persons and ideas which promised to turn the study of the human mind into an experimental science..

The responses of the community of physicists to these distinct patterns of research publication were investigated.. Quality of output is more significant than quantity in eliciting recognition through the receipt of awards, appointment to prestigious academic departments, and being widely known to one's colleagues..

Four strong determinates of visibility were found: the quality of work, as measured by citations; the honorific awards received for work in physics; the prestige of the physics department to which the scientist belong; and speciality.. Quantity of output, age, and name-ordering patterns on collaborative papers have no independent effect on visibility.. Just as some physicists may be easily seen (i.e., have high visibility), other are in positions where they may easily see..

This model provides a reasonably good fit to age-distributions of footnotes in several disciplines, and its application suggest that citations  in sociology tend to refer to older articles than those in the natural sciences..A parameter in the model, measuring the degree of selectivity in favor of recent articles, can be estimated and may be useful in comparative studies of the communication systems of various disciplines..

A series of hypotheses were developed in which relatively high paradigm development in a discipline was predicted to facilitate research and teaching through improved processes of communication and access to stored information.. Using questionnaire data collected from 80 university graduate departments, physicists and chemists were found to exhibit more agreement over field content, and to be more willing and satisfied to spend time with graduate students than sociologists and political scientists.. In addition, chemists were found to collaborate with larger numbers of graduate students in research than scientists in the other fields.. Two other aspects of scientific structure are discussed: the level of innovation being pursued within a field of a given time, and the degree of institutionalized differentiation of the field into subdisciplines.. \", '108': 'Productivity Differences among Scientists: Evidence for Accumulative Advantage Allison, Paul D. Stewart, John A The highly skewed distributions of productivity among scientists can be partly explained by a process of accumulative advantage.. Because of feedback through recognition and resources, highly productive scientists maintain or increase their productivity, while scientists who produce very little produce even less later on.. A major implication of accumulative advantage is that the distribution of productivity becomes increasingly unequal as a cohort of scientists ages.. Cross-sectional survey data support this hypothesis for chemists, physicists, and mathematicians, who show strong linear increases in inequality with increasing career age.. This increase is highly associated with a changing distribution of time spent on research.. Another implication of accumulative advantage is also corroborated: the association among productivity, resources and esteem increases as career age increases..

Informal communication among biological scientists forms a discernible social structure.. This research analyzes the relation of that structure to (1) scientists' descriptions of their research and the orientations that underlie those descriptions, (2) social status in science, and (3) the formal social categories of science (i.e. discipline, department, and research organization).. Each of the observed structures is contrasted with a random model.. Neither social status nor the formal social categories show greater association on the social structure than to the random model.. The culture of science, on the other hand, as represented by description of research and the orientations underlying those descriptions, shows very strong associations with the discerned network structures.. \", '110': \"The Gatekeepers of Science:  Some Factors Affecting the Selection of Articles of Scientific Journals Crane, D.

The present study attempted to extend previous work on bibliographical reference patterns in sociological journals in the following ways: (1) by selecting for study those journals to which American sociologists prefer to submit their work, (2) by including, over a two-year period, all bibliographical references (journals, books, technical reports, etc.), and (3) by including, for initial comparison, a journal from the physical sciences.

The Problem of assessing the \"quality\" of scientific publications has long been a major impediment to progress in the sociology of science.  Most researchers have typically paid homage to the belief that quantity of output is not the equivalent of quality and have then gone ahead and used publication counts anyway (Coler, 1963; Crane, 1965; Price, 1963; Wilson, 1964).  There seemed to be no practicable way to measure the quality of large numbers of papers or the life\\'s work of large numbers of scientists.  The invention of the Science Citation Index (SCI) a few years ago provides a new and reliable tool to measure the significance of individual scientists\\' contributions.  Starting in 1961, the SCI has listed all bibliographic references appearing in an increasingly large number of journals.  The number of citations an individual receives may be tabulated and used as an indicator of the relative scientific significance or \"quality\" of that individual\\'s publications.

In corresponding chapters of earlier volumes of this review may be discerned a trend toward progressive broadening of content coverage.  The initial emphasis was on design and evaluation concepts and on techniques that were rather closely - and narrowly - connected with information storage and retrieval systems.  It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that there are many activities and ideas outside of this context that have, or can have, a very important bearing on the work of systems analysts, designers, and evaluators working on library and documentation systems.  This chapter attempts to continue enlarging our perception of the range of reported activities that can help to improve the kinds of systems in which our readers are chiefly interested.

While we may call ourselves librarians, information scientists or technologists, abstractors and indexers, documentalists, IS&R specialists, literature searchers, and so forth, we all have one thing in common: We are either directly or indirectly involved in the dissemination of information.  As disseminators, we are interested in far more than the techniques for transmission of information from one point to another.  Despite McLuhan\\'s (93) statement that \"the medium is the message,\" we must concern ourselves with not only the means of document dissemination, but also the content and value of the documents we disseminate.  This idea is prevalent throughout most of the papers reviewed in this chapter.  A disseminator should think of himself as a selective switching center, inputting data, evaluating them, selecting worthy items, and directing and controlling their transmission to a target: the reader.

The rapidly growing rate at which information is produced and used in our complex society has presented us with major problems in information transfer.  We encounter these problems not only in libraries, information centers, and schools, but also in many of the operations of government and business.  The handling of large amounts of information is becoming a dominant theme in the management of our way of life.  We are a technologically oriented society, and we have naturally turned to our communications technology to help us perform our enormous information transfer task.  Beginning with the telegraph and continuing through the telephone, through radio and television to the communications satellite, the methods of electrical signal transmission have served to distribute information to its ultimate users.

Some of the trends that were commented on in Volume 6 have proved to be solid and important.  For example, the movement toward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data bases is not very strong, and it will probably not be many years before satisfying experience with this new mode of information access will help it become not merely an experimental innovation but the standard means of searching and using centrally (or regionally) held data.  Three chapters in this volume touch on related aspects of the movement: Bennett's review of the user interface in interactive systems, Gechman's report on machine-readable bibliographic data bases, and Brandhorst and Eckert's review of document retrieval and dissemination systems. This volume also introduces a new Annual Review topic of potentially great importance for future libraries: video cartridges and cassettes. It is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will, in the coming years, shift the balance of their holdings in the direction of some of the newer media, and the chapter by Kletter and Hudson helps to define the potential and problems of some of the promising new media.  Other new areas of interest are information system applications in the criminal justice system and information system applications in the humanities. In addition to these topics, this volume covers three of the core areas of information science, which we attempt to review on as close to an annual basis as possible: information needs and uses, document description and representation, and organization of information.  This coverage is consistent with a newly developed Annual Review master plan for cyclic but flexible coverage of some 40 major areas of interest in library and information science. \", '124': 'The User Interface in Interactive Systems Bennett, J.L. The digital computer has been used as a problem-solving tool for only two decades.  During most of this time, computer scientists have concentrated on learning how to build the tool: applying electronic technology, arranging for data flow between components, and manufacturing the hardware.  Now we are entering a new stage in which computing power is made available through interactive terminals to people who are not computer scientists.  This is possible on a large scale only because design and marketing innovators now have confidence in their ability to provide reliable, cost-effective service to less sophisticated users.  In this new stage, the natural behavior patterns of users become an important element in the design of the interface to the tool.

Currently, the creation and application of these data bases are in a period of very rapid growth.. This reviewer sees a great need for a review of \"what is going on\" because there is so much going on.. It is the goal of this chapter to fulfill that need even though it is difficult to hold this dynamic field static for a good meaningful look.. ', '126': 'Annual Reviews of Information Science and Technology Cuadra, C.A. 1974 The major trends of the 1970\\'s in information system planning and services are becoming clear, as indicated in this year\\'s Annual Review chapters.  The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking, began gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishment of many new library consortia, and there were some tentative efforts to use computers for nationwide bibliographic information \"utilities.\" These movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being cost-effective, productive ventures.  Inter-institutional cooperation not only promises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new problems and demands.  Formalized cooperation among different institutions requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user subgroups.  It also requires more careful and productive system planning and design, including intelligent consideration of the \"make versus buy\" issue.  Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and considerations. One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth in the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated by the federal government and those operated by the private sector.  The apparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same problems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed materials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less rapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs, serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes.  The inclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series - reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the ownership and distribution of information.  Another aspect of that controversy - the role of government and non-profit information services in relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year\\'s chapter on document retrieval systems and techniques. ', '127': 'Use of Machine-Readable Data Bases Williams, M.E. This is the first Annual Review chapter entitled \"Use of Machine- Readable Data Bases.\"  Therefore, the coverage provided is for more than a one-year period.  A chapter by Gechman (79) on machine-readable bibliographic data bases included literature from 1969 through 1971.  A chapter by Housman (100) covered the use of data bases for selective dissemination of information (SDI) and a chapter by Parkins & Kennedy (153) has previously reviewed secondary information services.  This chapter will cover the 1973 literature on data bases as well as earlier data base papers not treated in prior chapters. For purposes of this chapter, a data base is considered to be an organized set of machine-readable records containing bibliographic or document-related data. ', '128': 'Design and Evaluation of Information Systems Swanson, R.W. The co-joining of \"design\" with \"evaluation\" that is called for by this chapter posed organizational and inclusion-exclusion problems for the author.  In part, \"design\" and \"evaluation\" prescribe two separate sets of activities, the former pertaining to the planning, development, and testing of new information system structures and modification of existing structures, the latter to appraisals and assessments of operational systems and system components.  However, \"design\" includes not only the formulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions for evaluation in accordance with expectations.  \"Evaluation\" applies to testing design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementations for the purpose of improving initial designs, as well as to the appraisal of operating systems.  Appraisals at any stage of system operability may yield data that indicate the need for system modifications that require redesign and assessment.  Thus, portions of \"design\" and \"evaluation\" are closely interrelated, as Katter demonstrated in his 1969 review. \"Design\" and \"evaluation\" may be examined methodologically or with respect to outcomes of the application of methodologies.  Increasingly, designers and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence of outcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations.  The current literature discloses research on the processes of design and evaluation as well as on their products. ', '129': \"Generation and Uses of Machine-Readable Data Bases Schipma, P.B. This chapter continues the coverage of the generation and use of machine-readable data bases inaugurated in Volume 9 by Williams (178).  It is therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared in general accordance with Williams's initial compilation. The same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications used in Volume 9 are continued this year.  A data base is considered to be an organized collection of machine-readable records containing bibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information). The data bases that we will consider are used for information storage and retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval or data base generation. The choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas.  First, data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic information, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded. Thus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number is a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such as that by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39) are excluded.  Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic material is included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, most of the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a shipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this chapter.  Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generation of publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that production operation. \", '130': 'Cooperation in Information Activities Through International Organizations Adams, S. Werdel,J.A. International cooperation in the processing, sharing, and transfer of scientific and technical information takes many forms and can be accomplished through many agencies.  This chapter proposes to review the role played by international organizations in stimulating and providing channels and mechanisms for such cooperation.  The international organizations to be discussed are of two types: intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), in which member nations participate through their governments under formal treaties or agreements; and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) where, with some exceptions, participation is through national professional societies or nongovernmental institutions.  The specialized agencies of the United Nations, including UNESCO, fall in the first category; organizations such as the International Federation for Documentation (FID) are in the second.

This field, which will be referred to as \"Information Science and Technology,\" draws on fragments and fringes of a number of sciences, technologies, disciplines, arts, and practices.  The element that provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is a shared deep concern with \"information\" - its generation, transformation, communication, storage, retrieval, and use. Because of the universality of information processes, and also because of the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them, there is very little agreement about the boundaries of Information Science and Technology, or about its parentage, its essential nature, or its future.  To put it simply, at the present time there is no clearly defined and well-understood field of Information Science and Technology.  There is not, truth to tell, even clear agreement on what the word \"information\" itself means and particularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or a commodity that can be embodied in documents, transported, and exchanged. Distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be, they need not and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interest to users, designers, and students of information systems and services. The purpose of the ADI Annual Review series, initiated in this volume, is to provide such a review. ', '132': 'Information Needs and Uses in Science and Technology Menzel, H. The way in which scientists and engineers make use of the information systems at their disposal, the demands that they put to them, the satisfaction achieved by their efforts, and the resultant impact on their further work are among the items of knowledge which are necessary for the wise planning of science information systems and policy.  Besides, these matters can be of great significance to the behavioral scientist interested in human organization and communication.  While \"user studies\" have not yet gone very far in serving either of these functions, the end of 1963 seems to have been something of a take-off point for empirical research on the information needs and uses of scientists and technologists.  For this first volume of the Annual Review, we shall therefore cover studies that made their appearance as far back as the last month of 1963, to give the reader a rounded picture of a period during which this area of research has witnessed progress along the following lines: Substantial advances in the more systematic and fruitful application of a technique (critical incidents) that had made its appearance in this field earlier in less rigorous forms; The introduction of at least two very promising approaches (solution development records; comparison of research teams working on identical tasks) quite different from any that had been applied to this field before; and An increase in the number of efforts at comprehensive study of the information-flow situation in given disciplines, one of which [American Psychological Association (3)] has become the model and envy of research in this area.

The selected, relevant, and available literature that has been published in the last year or so is organized into four groups as follows: 1. Articles that help define the process of systems analysis and the relationship to information science. 2. Articles that describe the concepts of systems analysis as applied to the analysis and design of information systems. 3.

Like its two predecessors, this volume attempts to describe and evaluate the most significant work that has been reported in the field during the past year, with the ultimate aim of improving both our standards and our means of professional communication. The field of information science and technology continues to evolve and grow.  As it does, new areas of interest emerge and established areas of interest change in importance.  Accordingly, our pattern of coverage changes.  The single chapter on Automation in Libraries and Information Centers, in Volume 2, has been expanded into two chapters, one covering automation of technical processes and the other covering document networks, and a new chapter has been added on information system applications in education.  Such applications are important not just because they involve, in part, libraries and other information facilities but because they highlight innovative ideas and techniques that should be of value to anyone interested in the total communication process. At the same time, \"core\" chapters of the review are continued:  information needs and uses; content analysis, specification, and control; file organization and search; publication and distribution techniques; automated language processing; man-machine communication; information system design and evaluation; and professional aspects of information science. These topics are of continuing and vital interest to our readers, and their annual literature is significant, large, and growing. ', '137': 'Information Needs and Uses Paisley, W.J. Information science meets behavioral science in the study of information needs and uses.  At first, the meeting of these fields was inconclusive.  Until the mid-1960\\'s, there were only a few substantial studies of information needs and uses.  Since about 1963, however, a significant literature has grown rapidly. There is evidence now of a productive entente between the fields. When information scientists see reliable, valid, and nontrivial data on users\\' behavior, they begin to use behavioral criteria in evaluating information system performance.  When behavioral scientists glimpse the full complexity of dissemination, documentation, storage, and retrieval processes, they offer fewer naive solutions to \"the information problem.\" This mutual education and accommodation will undoubtedly continue. Information science and behavioral science need each other.  Big Science needs them both.

The basic objective - to provide the most comprehensive and technically sound progress review ever prepared in the information science field - remains the same, as do the basic areas of interest and coverage.  Too, the primary emphasis continues to be on published literature and reports, to permit the reader to identify, locate, and examine interesting and important sources of information about various aspects of our technical progress. Some new areas of growing importance are introduced this year.  For the first time, a chapter on reprography and microfilm technology and one on the international aspects of information transfer have been included.  Also, the topics of document dissemination and the secondary services, usually covered in parts of other chapters, have full and separate chapters this year.  Another change, made in response to suggestions from readers for better signposts within each volume, is the division of the book into several major segments, each introduced by a short description of the contents of the section, the relationships among the chapters within it, and, in some instances, one or two highlights of the year's technical progress. \", '139': 'Information Needs and Uses Allen, T.J. Previous authors in this series, writing on this subject, have usually felt it necessary to begin with a statement concerning the state of the methodology of \"user\" studies.  They have, for the most part, found it improved over the past, and this year is no exception in that regard. There remains, however, the tendency on the part of many who are untrained in social science methodology to assume that the art of questionnaire design and administration is a very simple one that anyone with intelligence can master in a single attempt.  One never realizes how truly wrong this view is until he finds himself the author of a review chapter and is then confronted with the sort of trivia that many authors submit as research papers. ', '140': \"Annual Review of Information Science and Technology Cuadra, C.A. 1970 The field of information science and technology continues to grow and, as it grows, to show new emphases and explore new areas of interest. Volume 5 reflects these changes.  The increasing interest in and movement toward library networks and other cooperative, technology-supported information activities have helped to focus special attention not only on data processing and microfilm technology, the two traditional mainstays of library and document-handling systems, but also on the rapidly developing capabilities in modern tele-communications. Thus, a chapter on communication technology has appeared, for the first time, to bring readers up to date on changes in the communications industry that have had or will have a great impact on how we design and use information-handling systems. Two other first-time chapters cover management information systems and information systems in state and local government.  While the intent behind the development of such systems, and the kinds of services they provide, is peripheral to the purposes and services of library and document-handling systems, one often sees in these peripheral areas some information parallels.  Indeed, one of the reasons for the Annual Review's covering one or more of these areas each year is to help its readers exploit more fully the thinking and the problem-solving techniques they are fostering. \", '141': 'Application of Computer Technology to Library Process: a syllabus Becker, J. The application of computer technology to library and network processes and services is not an end in itself, but rather a means of narrowing the gap between the demand for library services and the ability of libraries to provide those services.  Libraries have assumed the active role of serving the informational, educational and recreational needs of the population.  The size of that population grows constantly, its educational level keeps climbing, and its percentage of leisure time is increasing. The application of computer technology to libraries, especially to the manipulation of bibliographic records in the performance of library functions, is a complex process and demands the highest level of talent of both the library and computer professions for its accomplishment.  It cannot be accomplished by either profession alone; rather, the design of a library system is a team effort between librarians, computer system analysts, and programmers.  Even a limited effort demands careful long-term planning if it is to fit with later efforts into a cohesive whole.  The smallest project will affect nearly all operations of the library.  For these reasons it is necessary that all library staff have at least a general overview of what library automation is all about. ', '142': \"Archives and Library Relations Clark, R.C. A distinct characteristic of man is the need to communicate and record knowledge.  The tools of communication have ranged from clay to satellites.  Civilized societies have taken great pains to place recorded knowledge in safe places and create archives and libraries for this purpose. The importance of recorded knowledge for survival and progress is constantly being elevated as more and more information is presented. Without information and its necessary control, a society is not only stagnant, but regressive.  With social memory, preserved and controlled by archives and libraries, a society is able to evolve to whatever future it is destined to experience in an ever-changing environment. Archives were the forerunners of libraries.  The ancient archives contained the best of society's accumulated knowledge; and as nations grew in wealth and security, archives and libraries become symbols of a country's aspiration to create a better society.  Today, archives and libraries are necessities.  These cultural institutions pass information to succeeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media.  In this way, archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and pass this memory on to living individuals.  The materials in these institutions contain the written and graphic record of social memory and human heritage and provide society with information on which to base actions, develop policies, ascertain rights, educate, and entertain. \", '143': \"The Area Specialist Bibliographer: an inquiry into his role Stuart, R.D.

Accordingly, the ASIDIC Cooperative Data Management Committee initiated a new survey. The questionnaires were mailed out in January of 1975 and responses came in throughout the year.  Questionnaires were sent to all member organizations of ASIDIC and EUSIDIC.  Questionnaires were also sent to individual members of ASIS SIG/SDI and SIG/UOI. Responses received throughout 1975 were checked and tabulated in 1976.  Because of the time delay in producing the final compilation the reader is warned against using this survey as an up-to-date source for information as to which centers are processing which data bases.

Of the 75 that process data bases (i.e., spin tapes) 51 (68%) are members of ASIDIC and/or EUSIDIC.  This survey provides representative data for data base processing organizations.  The use of online search services was relatively new in 1974 hence data regarding online users would not be representative of the 1976 online situation.

Since Bernal made his pilot survey of the use of scientific literature for the 1948 Royal Society Scientific Information Conference, at least three dozen other investigations have been reported of the needs of scientists and engineers for information, of their information gathering habits, and the use to which they put information. Some of these have been concerned with the people in individual organizations, but have implications elsewhere.  Others, including Aslib's own investigations, have had wider aims.  Some have been based upon observations and records of what the scientists and engineers themselves did or said, and some upon records of the demands they made upon libraries.  There have been both surveys of opinions, and collections of facts. \", '148': 'Fair (Fast Access Information Retrieval) Project; Aims and Methods Pickford, A.G.A.

Simkins, M.A. During the past year we have been one of the organizations participating in the Chemical Society's experiment on the use of routine computer searches of Chemical Titles (CT) and Chemical- Biological Activities (CBAC) for current awareness.  For some time we have also been subscribing to the Automatic Subject Citation Alert (ASCA), which is produced by the Institute for Scientific Information as a by-product of the Science Citation Index.  These three sources differ in their scope and methods, but share the same ultimate objective of providing a computer-based current awareness service. CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides only authors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved. CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with biological systems, but provides abstracts which are available for computer search.  The computer can also search for molecular formulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of all compounds included in the abstracts.  ASCA in its original form was based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list of references to older work, and the output is then a list of new papers citing this work.  Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', which is a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore analogous to a CT search. This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so far with these three services, and the potential use of systems of this type. \", '151': \"Thesaurus Compilation Methods:  A Literature Review Blagden, J.F. This review has been sponsored by the Office for Scientific and Technical Information and the end product of the complete research will be a thesaurus of management terms.  Parallel research in the business management area and also supported by OSTI is being conducted by David Dews, Librarian of the Manchester Business School, and K.D.C. Vernon, Librarian of the London Graduate School of Business Studies.  As Mr. Vernon is at present engaged in the construction of a faceted classification scheme for management, this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizing faceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus. A study of existing information retrieval systems in the management field has already been made, so a decision to adopt some form of post-co-ordinate indexing was assumed.  Thus a comparative study of other systems will not be attempted.  A decision has also already been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus, was eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfield results that appear to provide evidence of the superiority of natural language over controlled vocabularies.  This was primarily because these results were restricted to tests on an aeronautical collection, and it may well be that the natural language of this discipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which is certainly not the case with the rather 'soft' language of management.  This is borne out to some extent by Halkin, who quotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organic chemistry (55 percent), engineering (35 percent), and social science (20 per cent). Machine methods of term generation as described by Ovchinnikov, Mastermann and Luhn will not be considered, as there is no equipment available to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest. \", '152': 'Organizational Aspects of Information Flow in Technology Allen, T.J.

The study was divided into three phases aimed at: I A Literature search to reflect the current 'state-of-the art' covering library standards and the methods of evaluating libraries developed up to the present. II A phase in which to gather and evaluate any data required from Army Technical Libraries, from available surveys already published, or from any other sources, by which to develop criteria.

Besides, I hope to be able to convince you - if the BSI's fine efforts have not already done so - that the UDC is by no means the dying duck - certainly not the dead duck - that some of its severest critics seem to imagine.  Perhaps the bird has ceased to soar as it once did in the times of Otlet, La Fontaine, Bradford and Donker Duyvis, but that it is still viable in the turbulent air of current documentation may be gauged from a recent FID inquiry aimed at obtaining figures for the distribution of UDC editions and an approximate estimate of the number of users throughout the world. \", '155': 'Subject Relations in Science/Technology Literature Earle, P.

Despite these defects, an examination of citations does enable one to sample acts of literature use within a large community.

May we please raise four questions which are important at the present time when government policy on information retrieval is being considered?

The SDC is making comparisons of the efficiency of various published indexes and other sources of scientific information and the first results of rigorously checked comparisons are becoming available for a case study on the subject of 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry'.  This results from an extensive literature search prepared by combining and collating results of searches in twelve of the world's major indexes to chemistry and spectroscopy, including searches of SDC's own data bank files.  Nearly two hundred unique references on 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry' were found and are being checked individually for relevance going back to the original paper or asking expert opinion where necessary. \", '157': 'On the Design of Information Systems for Human Beings Line, M.B.

In short-term planning, the danger exists that the more technical problems may be solved, without attention to their implications for human beings; to take my housing example, higher and higher flats may be built, without considering the possible effects (e.g. the effect on social groupings).  In long-term planning, Utopian or ideological blueprints may be produced. ', '158': 'Standard Costing for Information Systems: Background to a Current Study Robertson, S.E. Reynolds, R. Wilkin, A.P. For some time past, interest has been developing within the Aslib Research Department in the problems of establishing standard costs for information systems.  A literature search recently conducted by the Department (R. Reynolds) has revealed a scarcity of usable information on this subject: such data as is available is difficult to evaluate comparatively because of the differing definitions of the operations costed and of the terms used to describe them.  It would seem, therefore, that a first step towards developing a costing method of widespread application would be the establishment of standard conventions for the analysis of information systems. One might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs for these systems, namely: (a) General survey method:  The overall costs of a large number of information systems are broken down into a small number of categories, and analysed for correlation (see, for example, C.J. Wessel et al). (b) In-depth study:  A small number of systems are studied in detail in an attempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affecting them. In a current project, we are attempting to apply method (b) to the production of current-awareness bulletins.  An outline of some of the preliminary work in this project follows.

I see from the programme that I am supposed to talk on an information language for MARC, and it is true that the work I have been doing for the past year or so has been under the auspices of the MARC Project.  But the subject indexing system we have developed is concerned as much with BNB's plans for computer production from 1971 as with the MARC tapes as such, and I hope to show that we have also gone some way towards developing a compatible general system with even wider application.  Before coming to this, however, it is necessary to describe briefly some of the day to day pressures of work which caused BNB to look to the computer for help.  From this we can see how the computer forced us to reconsider our whole approach to subject indexing. \", '160': \"Analysis and Organization of Knowledge for Retrieval Farradane, J.E.L. In a university, the mode of research is usually what is called 'pure' or 'basic' research; since I am keeping in mind primarily the applications of information science, I will prefer the word 'basic', although there is not so much difference.  In such research, and really in any good research, one should not be collecting data haphazardly.  One must isolate and define a problem and, as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors are eliminated.  Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageable proportions.  It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort of hypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtaining evidence for or against that hypothesis.  The important task is to devise just that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible. If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence upon which to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, one is ready for a further step forward, and so on.  Research is easier in a fully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or human situation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this does not alter the general methodology.  On the whole, I find a clear methodology lacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today. \", '161': \"User Studies:  A Review of the Literature from 1966 to 1970 Wood, D.N.

It considers a wide range of investigations into the information gathering habits of scientists, engineers, social scientists and others, and reports results which it is hoped will provide managers with information on which to develop policies regarding library and information services at all levels.

When INFROSS began in the autumn of 1967, although a large number of studies had been conducted into the requirements of scientists for information, very little had been done in the field of social science information.  There are a number of possible reasons for this.  Social scientists, faced with a much smaller total volume of information, were much less information-conscious and less inclined to seek for solutions.  There are very few specialist libraries in the social sciences, and few librarians were therefore confronted with social scientists' information needs in the same way as librarians in scientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems.  Finally, until OSTI came along there was little in the way of funds to support this kind of research.  This almost total absence of previous research had its disadvantages and advantages.  There were very few clues to guide us, and we were therefore working to a certain extent in the dark.  On the other hand, we had a clean and open field uncorrupted by confusing and non-comparable studies.

In the context of the present symposium it would seem appropriate that I should deal specifically with the economic aspects of Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) operation and use.

At Shell Research in Sittingbourne we have been operating, since 1967, an SDI service for the research staff and it has grown rapidly, particularly since we started to use the CA Condensates tapes early in 1969.  In addition to these tapes we are currently using the BA Previews tapes, AGDOC tapes (prepared by ourselves using punched card input received from Derwent) and, on an experimental basis, Toxitapes, produced by BIOSIS, Philadelphia.

By the continuous growth of a documentation system in the physical and conceptual respect, steadily increasing demands are made on the degree of order which prevails in the system or can be established at the specific request of an inquirer.  If the order in a system cannot keep pace with the increasing requirements, its working capability will continuously decrease, because the searcher is becoming more and more overburdened in relation to his available search time, search patience, and search memory.  The degree of order attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on the basis of six postulates.  The better the requirements imposed by these postulates are approximated in a practical documentation system, the higher are its working capability and life expectancy, but the expenditure to be made on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher. The establishment of these postulates originated from practical experience with the IDC-system and its precursors.  These postulates form the basis of this system and of its further development.

I am sure you do not need reminding of the flood of scientific information that is available today and the estimates of its growth in the next two decades.  In 1967, Olaf Helmer, then Senior Mathematician at the Rand corporation, forecast that scientists and engineers would increase from five million, in 1967, to twenty-five million by the year 2000 and their total productivity would go up by a factor of ten.  He declined to assess the associated growth of, and need for, scientific information but merely stated that there would be substantial changes in the way in which science would actually be transacted.  It is these 'substantial changes' that concern the publisher, editor, information scientist and librarian, because if we do not anticipate - or at least keep pace with these changes - then we will not be able to meet the information needs of our readers and we will become redundant.  Scientific information is a growing industry and it would be ironic if we could not survive amid an abundance of information.  I regard the chance to do something about the flow of information as a response to opportunity, not as an act of desperation.  The big problem is to sort out what is pertinent among this information and, in this world of rapid change, select and develop the technological devices that will match the needs of the scientist to this mass of information. \", '167': 'Rationalization of Serial Holdings in Special Libraries Houghton, B.

The idea that a language is based on a system of rules determining the interpretation of its infinitely many sentences is by no means novel.  Well over a century ago, it was expressed with reasonable clarity by Wilhelm von Humboldt in his famous but rarely studied introduction to general linguistics (Humboldt, 1836).  His view that a language \"makes infinite use of finite means\" and that its grammar must describe the processes that make this possible is, furthermore, a outgrowth of a persistent concern, within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind, with this \"creative\" aspect of language use (for discussion, see Chomsky, 1964, forthcoming).  What is more, it seems that even Panini\\'s grammar can be interpreted as a fragment of such a \"generative grammar,\" in essentially the contemporary sense of this term. This monograph is an exploratory study of various problems that have arisen in the course of work on transformational grammar, which is presupposed throughout as a general framework for the discussion.  What is at issue here is precisely how this theory should be formulated.  This study deals, then, with questions that are at the border of research in transformational grammar.  For some, definite answers will be proposed; but more often the discussion will merely raise issues and consider possible approaches to them without reaching any definite conclusions.

Definition of the Manpower Problem and Research Desing Kronick, David A. Rees, Alan M. Rothenberg, Lesliebeth In order to plan adequately for education in health science librarianship and to be able to project future demands and needs we need to know a great deal more about existing  manpower in health science libraries.. This paper, the first in a series of reports on an investigation to gather this data, discusses the research methodology and the development of an inventory of the institution program population upon which the survey is based.. An analysis in terms of geographic location, type (educational, research, etc.), administrative control, and primary cognate area of these institutions is presented, and their distribution through the various Regional Medical Library areas is noted.. Preliminary estimates are made, based on questionnaire to the libraries, on the size of the library population, their relationship to reporting programs or institutions, exclusive of the hospital population which is being covered in an independent survey.. A questionnaire to library personnel is underway which will establish, along with the other questionnaires, a basis for exploring the relationships which exist between institutions or programs, libraries and manpower..

As part of an investigation of health sciences library manpower, the universe of health-related institutions and programs (excluding hospitals) was surveyed by postcard questionnaire to produce an inventory and description of libraries providing services to these institutions reported access to library resources, indicating usage of some 2,207 non-hospital libraries.. Eighty percent (2,431) of the institutions reported that the library used was \"within\" their own institution; 20 percent (608) noted that the library was \"outside\" of their institution.. The distribution of health-related institutions and libraries is shown by RML districts, together with relevant census data.. A classification of libraries, based on the degree of involvement of the libraries\\' facilities, resources and personnel in supplying services to health-related institutions, was developed.. It is concluded that projections of manpower needs should take into account institutions and programs not at present possessing health sciences libraries as well as documented demand in existing health sciences libraries..

Rees, Alan M. An investigation of the manpower requirements of health sciences libraries and of educational programs appropriate to these manpower needs was begun in March 1968.. To data, 4,727 libraries have been identified as being used by 14,000 health sciences institutions and programs.. Of this total, 2,628 are hospital libraries; 1,328 are health sciences libraries; and 771 are academic or public libraries.. Within these libraries some 14,938 persons are directly involved, either full- or part-time, in the delivery of health sciences library services.. Of the total work force, 5,861 persons are employed in hospital libraries and 9,077 are employed in health sciences libraries and collections.. The ratio between professional and nonprofessional employees is 1:2; professional and nonprofessional status was assigned by the chief librarian..

Kronick, David A. A statistical description based on a mail survey of personnel in 2,099 health sciences libraries located outside of the hospital setting is reported.. Respondents to the survey were divided into three groups: professionals (those possessing a graduate library degree); nonprofessionals (those not possessing graduate library degree); and chief librarians (those responsible for a library's operations).. Survey items dealt with education, sex, age, salary, job mobility and preference for continuing education programs.. Some 60 percent of the respondents were professionals; 40 percent were nonprofessionals.. Seven hundred and twenty-eight chief librarians were identified in the population: 57 percent were professional librarians while the remainder were without a graduate library degree.. Approximately 1/5 of all survey respondents were men.. The age distribution for the work force tended to be bimodal, reflecting the career patterns of women and the later entry of men into librarianship.. The annual salary for male professionals was calculated at $12,732; for female professionals at $10,044; for male nonprofessionals at $7,878; and for female nonprofessionals at $6,313.. Male professionals were found to have the highest rates of job and geographic mobility.. Conversely, female nonprofessionals were lowest in mobility.. In expressing a preference for continuing education programs in library science, professionals tended to request courses dealing with the organization of libraries, health sciences institutions and their relationships, while nonprofessionals inclined towards courses in technical processing.. \", '189': 'Selected list of Books and Journals for the Small Medical Library Brandon, Alfred N.

A survey testing user reactions was conducted at the University of Virginia Medical Library.. The results of the survey are based on replies by 246 users who requested one or more MEDLINE searches between September 1972 and March 1973.. The findings indicate that over 93% believe that MEDLINE is a substantial improvement over the traditional methods of searching through the printed indexes.. These respondents also stated that the results of MEDLINE searches had assisted them in their clinical or research work, or both.. Asked whether they would continue to use MEDLINE after the imposition of user charges on July 1, 1973, about 75% said that they would.. The remaining 25% expressed some reservation and doubts..

The system, called AIM-TWX, was sponsored by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications and utilized a time-shared IBM 360/67 computer in Santa Monica, California.. Citations from 109 clinically-oriented  journals from 1966 to date, including those currently included in the Abridged Index Medicus, may be retrieved either on- or off-line.. Various aspects of this service are described, including problems of staffing, training, and record keeping, as well as the role of the MeSH vocabulary which is the principle \"language\" of the man-computer dialog.. The statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately 200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were run on any given day, or about 4.6 searches per hour of use.. In spite of an inexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the MeSH vocabulary and whose training schedule was limited to one four-hour session, the experiment was highly successful in terms of searches and citations.. At the end of the period, 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors, and  5,343 citations had been produced.. Only fifty-five searches yielded no citations.. The experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interest among the staff of the Library and of the Medical Center.. Moreover, a large number of medical practitioners in large and small communities  of Virginia participated in this experiment, indicating that there exists a great demand for this type of literature searching which AIM-TWX is able to provide with great rapidity.. ', '198': 'Choosing Physiology Journals Brodman, E. For many years administrators of library collections have sought objective criteria for assembling well-rounded periodical collections in the subject fields represented by their collections.  The nearest approach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledge of the specialist was first suggested by Gross and Gross in 1927.  This method consists, essentially, of counting the bibliographic citations at the conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field under consideration, and of arranging the journals cited in order of the frequency of their citation.  Thus, in the field of chemistry, the references in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are counted and a list is made of the most frequently cited journals.  According to Gross and Gross, the journals which are cited most frequently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are the most valuable journals for a library to purchase in order to possess a well-rounded collection in chemistry. Although the Gross and Gross method has been in use for almost twenty years, the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based have never been examined.  These assumptions are: 1. The value of a periodical to a professional worker is in direct proportion to the number of times it is cited in the professional literature. 2. The journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation are representative of the entire field. 3. If more than one journal is used as a base, all of them can be weighted equally.

The sustained interest in documentation, as a key to the retrieval of information in the literature of the sciences, has obscured largely the potential utility of statistical bibliography as a method of analyzing information needs.  In the belief that a discussion of the latter may be of value to interested biomedical librarians and scientists, a review of investigative methods and results in the health sciences is offered here. Statistical bibliography may be defined as the assembling and interpretation of statistics relating to books and periodicals; it may be used in a variety of situations for an almost unlimited number of measurements. Within the last forty years bibliographical statistics have been collected and explained in several fields of science for these main purposes: to demonstrate historical movements, to determine the national or universal research use of books and journals, and to ascertain in many local situations the general use of books and journals.

Mechanical means for expediting library work have been considered for many years, as an examination of the early pages of Library Journals bears out. The very first volume of the forerunner of the Bulletin, the Medical Library and Historical Journal, moreover, contained an article on the use of the \"typewriting machine\" in cataloging.  Telephones have long been accepted as library machines, and, except for unusual items, hand bookbinding has given way to machine-bound books. Nevertheless, when the term \"machine methods\" is used for libraries today, the prevailing idea is that expensive and complicated electronic equipment must be employed, and, since few libraries are able to afford such equipment for themselves, it is generally assumed that none but the largest libraries (the Library of Congress or the National Library of Medicine, for example) will be able to employ already existing mechanical methods or devise systems specifically applicable to their own situations.

Users of information in science and technology have been studied in great detail with respect to material read, amount of time spent in reading and searching the literature, categories of questions asked, an so on.. Probing for this information has been undertaken by means of structured  and unstructured  interviews, diaries, surveys, and questionnaires.. Although a large amount of data has emerged on information usage and flow, the subjective response of scientists furnishes comment only on the satisfaction produced by present information services and does not yield insight into the extent to which needs remain unsatisfied.. Relevance  figures based upon the response of systems to questions cannot be equated with satisfaction of needs, since questions constitute, in most cases, inadequate representations of underlying information needs.. Assessment of the needs of users of medical libraries and information system must, in fact, be made in relation to the observed behavior and experience of biomedical scientists.. There is room for well-designed experimentation which can explore the interaction of both psychological and environmental factors.. Significant differences in information needs exist among and between individuals such as researches and clinicians  in the same environment.. With respect to environment, it is hypothesized that the information needs for medical practitioners in remote areas might differ significantly from those of their colleagues working in large metropolitan centers in close proximity to medical schools, research institutions, and other rich sources of information fallout.. It is anticipated that experimentation will eventually result in a methodology which will permit the determination and prediction of the information needs of any identified groups of users in a specific environment..

The primary test data are summarized as statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents in the test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of the mean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents.. A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library, as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability afforded by its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection, processing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gain realized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing).. For a particular library, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variables can be  calculated easily from the capability measures and the status statistics.. Regression equations are derived that provide useful predictions of basic capability from collection size.. The most important result of this work is that cost-effectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decision aids in managing a basic library service.. A program of periodic surveys and further development of DDT's is recommended as appropriate for the Medical Library Association.. \", '224': 'The Implementation, Evaluation, and Refinement of a Manual SDI Service Yunis, Susan S.

The SDI service is compared to Current Contents, with the finding that 60 percent of the SDI participants prefer it to Current Contents.. For this select portion of researchers the Index Medicus SDI is the more suitable mode of current awareness..

Our articles of faith are simple.  We believe that, in order to understand contemporary economic decision making, we need to supplement the study of market factors with an examination of the internal operation of the firm - to study the effects of organizational structure and conventional practice on the development of goals, the formation of expectations, and the execution of choices.

The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication.  A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject.  In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point.  Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities.  These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem.  The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages.  The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. ', '229': 'A Mathematical Theory of Communication Shannon, C.E. In this final installment of the paper we consider the case where the signals or the messages or both are continuously variable, in contrast with the discrete nature assumed until now.  To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis.  As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case.  There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases. We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results with the greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, since this would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and would obscure the main thread of the analysis.  A preliminary study, however, indicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic and rigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases and many others. The occasional liberties taken with limiting processes in the present analysis can be justified in all cases of practical interest.

Several possible methods of sampling of social science monograph titles in the general library of Purdue University were considered, and a \"good\" method was used to obtain estimates of their usage in the library and at home during the period July 1 - August 4, 1964.. The term relative usage was defined and used to study the effect of: (1) language, (2) country of publication, (3) year of publication, and (4) year of accession of a monograph title.. An attempt was made to fit a regression model for titles in English by quantifying the last three independent variables with relative usage as the dependent variable.. Functions based on the above variables have been developed to identify monograph titles for storage.. A questionnaire was employed to stady the usage of library facilities and to gather opinions of library patrons.. Purpose of visiting the library, reason for checkout of library material, reason for preferring library or home for the use of library material, etc., were analyzed on the basis of the replies received..

Other special interests such as informal power-holders and the subprofessional are identified.. This analysis shows that existing organizational relationships in libraries let \"means\" become \"ends\".. Strong forces toward conformity hamper desirable growth and change.. A restructuring of libraries is proposed along the lines of professional rather than semiprofessional organizations..

Courses described in the college catalog are matched with the books listed in the American Book Publishing Record, BPR, Cumulative 1965.. Courses, treated as if monographes, are designed Dewey classification numbers and arranged in decimal sequence by groups.. Books in BPR falling into the groups are tallied; the DC groups are then rearranged by departments and the number and cost of books in each are totaled.. Results are sound estimates of each department's probable current domestic book needs for that year and may be applied to the subsequent year as an estimate of what will probably be needed.. They may be used as factors in an allocation formula.. \", '272': 'Professionalism Reconsidered Bundy, Mary Lee Wasserman, Paul The question of librarianship as a profession is considered here in terms of the three key relationships of a professional-client, organizational and professional.. Professional practice in this field is thus cast against accepted norms and standards of professional behavior.. This critical assessment suggests that librarianship falls far short of the professional model.. Major shifts in the nature of the services performed by librarians and in their bureaucratic relationships will be required if librarianship is to advance.. The contributions of the professional associations and of library schools to the advancement of the process of professionalization is also analyzed.. Progress in the field is viewed to be inextricably tied to the success or failure which librarianship achieves in its quest for true professional attainment..

Library administrators could adjudge their likely fortunes in the academic tug-of war for funds if they understood more clearly the attitudes of institutional administrators toward libraries.. Some view the library as \"a bottomless pit\"; all recognize that the library is unlikely to generate much political pressure for its own aggrandizement.. Many young institutional administrators are coming to apply more sophisticated measures to their funding formulas than have been utilized in the past..Librarians therefore would be well advised to become more proficient in modern management techniques and program budgeting concepts..

When they go through librarians they must develop their questions through four levels of need, referred to here as the visceral, conscious, formalized, and compromised needs.. In this pre-search interview with an information-seeker the reference librarian attempts to help him arrive at an understanding od his \"compromised\" need by determining: (1) the subject of his interest; (2) his motivation; (3) his personal characteristics; (4) the relationship of the inquiry to file organization; and (5) anticipated answers.. The author contends that research is needed into the techniques of conducting this negotiation between the user and the reference librarian..

The statistics can help the librarian decide how to allocate the budget to departments.. Traditional counts, by department personnel or by broad Dewey or LC classes, are imprecise.. An analogy between curriculum and circulation can be constructed by classifying courses in the college catalog (by DC or LC), rearranging the numbers thus generated by department, and then counting circulation within those groups.. The analogy is thus a quantitative measure and a precise reflection of library use according to curriculum.. ', '276': 'The Title Catalog: A Third Dimension Nitecki, Joseph Z. The accessibility of the card catalog seems to be inversely proportional to the complexity of its arrangement.. A catalog divided into author-title and subject sequence simplifies the filing order of cards and facilitates the use of each catalog.. It is argued here that a three-way division into author, title, and subject catalogs will further augment these advantages.. In this paper a separation of the title catalog at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee library is described and evaluated..

The authors derive a book fund distribution formula from a factor analysis of twenty-two variables which measure and quantify academic departments.. The analysis generates a 22 x 22 matrix of correlations.. A few of the significant correlations are discussed; e.g. those between books published and books circulated (high correlation) and circulation-by-subject and circulation-by-person (low correlation).. The factor analysis sorts out the complex relationships between the twenty-two variables and reduces them to three main factors - two of which seem to describe materials used and users.. The third may describe needs.. The three factors are the chief elements in the formula.. Each factor can be represented by any one or more of the variables in that factor..

Durand, Norma The authors contrast the university catalog and the card catalog and conclude that the university catalog is the best guide to the university's current scholarly interest.. They urge that librarians study and classify courses therein, such as books, using the Library of Congress or Dewey Decimal schemes so that specific class number are grouped by academic department and become substantial spans.. The profile can be used as a selection tool, as a correlating tool between curriculum, circulation and publishing, and as a device to aid weeding and shelving..

The traditional over-the-counter circulation count is not always considered a reliable indicator of total library use.. To test this assumption the author hypothesized that no correlation exists between the subjects of books taken out of the library and those used within the library.. Counts were made of books left on tables, chairs, desks, and other surfaces and correlated to books charged out.. Two studies were made.. In the first, books were counted within finely delineated LC and Dewey class spans relating to academic departments.. In the second, books were counted within the broad LC first and second letters and the Dewey tens.. In the first case, the overall correlation was .86; in the second, with less data, .84.. The author concludes that out-of-library circulation totals can be reliable indicators of in-library use.. For predicting in-library use (and thus total use) two methods are cited-simple ratio of out to in, and the regression equation..

Never noted for their willingness to accept innovative suggestions and implement change from outside sources, academic libraries have remained institutions in which changes in service policies and programs originated from internal sources only..

The criticism and transformation of society can be divorced only at our peril from the criticism and transformation of theories about society.  Yet the gap between theory and practice, so common in the history of American radical movements, is in some quarters growing wider.  Some of the most militant of American radicals, in the New Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at least temporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory. This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins.  In some part it is due to the fact that these social movements are still new and their political activism consumes their necessarily limited energies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need time to produce their new theories.  Although the neglect of theory is scarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the fact that American radicals are often more American than they know and may prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to the intangible outputs of theory.  Again, part of their neglect of theoretical problems is probably due to the close links that some young radicals have with the \"hippie\" contingent of their generation, whose more expressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culture dispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile \"hassles\" of intellectual confrontation.  There is also a vocal minority who, as has been said, feel personally excluded when they hear an appeal to reason.

Goffman, W. Belzer, J. In this note we attempt to point out why boolean functions are, in general, not applicable in information retrieval systems. First, we wish to stress that a system, which supposedly is to serve a certain purpose, has to try to optimize some overall performance rather than certain detailed parts of it.  This situation is, of course, well known. Saying that a system should cater to an optimal performance implies that the reward varies with different circumstances. That is, there may always be some customers who will not agree that the system's output is satisfactory.  However, these should be relatively few.  In the case of an information retrieval system, let us consider one whose function is to furnish a reference list as a reaction to a question. So, if we have a set of documents S and a set of questions Q, the system has to assign to each question q, an answer A(q) which is a subset of S.  Naturally, this answer cannot be chosen arbitrarily; it should reflect a relation between the question and the resulting reference list.  Usually one says that the documents in the list are relevant to the question.  More precisely stated, we assume that the enquirer expects a certain reference list, namely the one he would have procured had he himself probed the documents in the set. \", '320': 'The Teachable Language Comprehender: A Simulation Program and Theory of Language Quillian, M.R. The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program designed to be capable of being taught to \"comprehend\" English text.  When text which the program has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large memory.  This memory is a \"semantic network\" representing factual assertions about the world. The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text.  By this means, the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory.  In this form it can be added into the memory. Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory\\'s prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed.  TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided.  Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind. The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically. That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future.

Using direct access computer files of bibliographic information, an attempt is made to overcome one of the problems often associated with information retrieval, namely, the maintenance and use of large dictionaries, the greater part of which is used only infrequently. A novel method is presented, which maps they hyperbolic frequency distribution of text characteristics onto a rectangular distribution.  This is more suited to implementation on storage devices. This method treats text as a string of characters rather than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are more even than those of word types.  The members of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.  The rectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a much simplified file organization and promises considerable cost advantages. text searching, information theory, filed organization, direct access, information retrieval, character string, bit vector 3.42 3.70 3.73 3.74 5.6 ', '322': 'The Community College Library Veit, F.

In this decade, professionals in the field of librarianship and the information sciences will continue to be faced with most of the problems that have haunted libraries for generations, problems that can be best summed up as the attempt to reduce the anonymity of information.  There will also be many new problems.  Some of these are already becoming apparent, while others are still unknown.  But librarians need not despair; the past record is clear.  Through the use of sophisticated electronic machines, we have begun to master the bibliographical control and retrieval of information, we have improved the communication between librarians and the consumers of information on a national and international basis, and we have refined the many problems concerned with cataloging and classifying information.  In addition, library education has been on the front line in trying to educate people to understand the complexities of organizing and disseminating information of all types.

The definiteness of the answers to certain questions irresistibly provokes more questions.  The happy feature is that the book provides information required to limit the effect to that of tantalizing rather than frustrating. For there is given here a wholly adequate description of the nature of the Corpus of Present-Day Edited American English on which this study is based, the details of its constituents, and the modes of its transfer to tape.  A replica of that tape is available at a small cost in money, which is minuscule compared to the cost in time needed to produce a like corpus.

The need to establish a filing code for computer arrangement has become increasingly apparent as more and more book catalogs and indexes have been prepared mechanically.  Many of the difficulties in manual filing, as shown in the A.L.A. Rules for Filing Catalog Cards, become even more intricate to cope with when computers are used.  Of course, if cost is not an object, the theoretical potentialities for computer programming are practically limitless.  However, modifications in rules and procedures can make the alphabetic arranging or merging of index, catalog, or bibliographic entries by computer more readily possible, and these modifications are made in this proposed code for computer filing of complex alphabetic entries. ', '327': \"Computer Handling of Chemical Structure Information Lynch, M.F. Far-reaching changes in the patterns of communication in science are at present in motion, which seem likely to have fundamental effects on scientists's use of and access to existing knowledge. These changes derive from the increasing involvement of computer techniques in the publication, dissemination and retrieval of scientific and technical information.  Many of the implications of the changes are not yet clear.  Information-handling is rapidly changing from a labour-intensive industry to a capital-intensive one, as soaring man-power requirements reflect the increasing flow of information and increasing demands for timeliness, accuracy, and improved access. But the changes to be effected also have major social implications; the reasons for publication and use of information are complex, reflecting the factors of a sociological nature which are still imperfectly understood.  The rate at which innovations in information- handling win acceptance from scientists is determined partly by their appreciation of the greater flexibility which the novel methods offer, but also by the sensitivity, on the part of the designers and operators of information systems, to the needs and habits of users, and to their perception of the usefulness of the newer methods. \", '328': 'Current approaches to classification and clump-finding at the Cambridge Language Research Unit Sparck-Jones, K. Jackson, David Computer programs for automatic classification are a desideratum in many fields.. Work on suitable procedures for handling large bodies of object/ property descriptions has been in progress at the Cambridge Language Research Unit for some years: this paper describes the current series of general-purpose programs which have been developed there, in which classes or \"clamps\" of objects are obtained, using a similarity matrix, by a simple iterative scan of the universe of objects, distributing them in such a way that an appropriate cohesion function is minimized.. This actual clump-finding process is embedded in a overall package in which the information given by a classification is manipulated in a variety of ways..

The words of natural language texts exhibit a Poisson (or Zipfian) rank- frequency relationship, i.e., a small number of common words accounts for a large proportion of word occurrences, while a large number of the words occur as singletons or only infrequently.. Inverted-file retrieval systems using free text data bases commonly identify words as the keys or index terms about which the file is inverted, and through which access is provided.. They therefore involve large and growing dictionaries and many entail inefficient utilization of storage because of the distribution characteristics.. An alternative approach may be based on the analysis of text in terms of sets of variable-length character strings, the frequency distributions of which are much less disparate than those of words.. This could lead to substantial reductions in dictionary size, and increased efficiency both in dictionary look-up times and storage utilization.

The work published here is rather like those conclusive statements of renaissance science that located the soul not in the human frame but in the human spirit.  The author of this work may face the wrath of the medievalists among our fellow professional catalogers.  At the least, the publication of this book should encourage a complete reappraisal of our cataloging methods, because the difference between title unit entry and author-equivalent unit entry, a confabulation of main and unit entry arising from tradition rather than practicality, can be clearly seen not only in the job classifications and job descriptions of cataloging departments, but also in our philosophy of librarianship.

As far as philosophers are concerned, the Conference seems to be justified precisely because of the present state of the Classification of Knowledge.  For two thousand years, the Classification of Knowledge has been a major philosophical problem.  Lately, it has evolved from a philosophical preoccupation into a specialized technique, a species of the general techniques of classification, far removed from philosophical preoccupations and equally ignored by philosophers.  At the present time there exist powerful technical models of classification and highly developed classifications of various branches of knowledge.  What is lacking is a satisfactory general classification of knowledge and an adequate clarification of the philosophical problems underlying such classification.  The need for clarification is important from the theoretical as well as practical point of view because the general systems of classification of knowledge depend on theories of knowledge.  It is therefore highly desirable that philosophers and specialists in classification get together and discuss problems of common interest.

This report and its recommendations are in response to the Commission\\'s request for \"a nationwide program of continuing education for personnel in the library and information science field.\"  While it is offered as only the start of an on-going process of developing a nationwide program, its recommendations are the result of an intensive nine-month project, involving hundreds of persons in the library and information science fields. Many of these persons participated in mini-charettes, in a written survey, or in personal interviews which addressed major issues such as: certification; organizational and individual incentives for continuing education; educational methods; and continuing education needs.  The contribution of these library personnel cannot be overstated. Their collective wisdom and perspective have led the Project team to many of its major recommendations.  However, as would be expected when such a large number of people are involved, there were differences of opinion, even as there are many differences of opinion reflected in the literature of continuing education emanating from the various professions.  In the present study, most of these differences related to the input into and control over the policies of the national structure.  Three alternative models which have been considered are outlined in Appendix D; alternatives to several specific features of the recommended model are presented at the end of Chapter 4.  Throughout the text, when issues are presented on which there is uncertainty because of the intensity of opinions expressed, these areas are identified.

This bibliography uses the traditional typology of libraries as its starting point - public, school, academic-research, and special libraries. This classification is most commonly used and provides a sufficiently clear distinction for the purposes of this work. Public libraries are those which are free to all residents of the library's district and supported primarily from general public funds or taxes levied for library purposes.  Local public libraries, systems of public libraries, and state library agencies are included in this category. School libraries are those maintained by the governing boards of schools whether they be public, private, or parochial.  School libraries at the elementary, junior high school, and senior high school level are included. Academic-research libraries include the libraries of institutions of higher education, both public and private, as well as libraries which, while they might be defined as either public or special, are widely known for their research resources.  Junior college libraries, college libraries, university libraries, and technical school libraries are included as academic libraries.  The Library of Congress, the Newberry Library, and Linda Hall Library are examples of nonacademic research libraries. Special libraries are those directed toward making information available to people within a particular organization with fairly well-defined information needs.  Business and industrial libraries and the libraries of nonprofit organizations are common examples. While distinctions between research and special libraries are not always easily made, it is felt that in the case of this bibliography, no serious problems are created. \", '341': 'Copying Methods Manual Hawken, N.R. The current need for a manual of copying methods dealing with the processes, methods, techniques, and types of equipment which can be used for reproducing documents of a great many different kinds arises from two factors: (1) The great importance of document reproduction processes in the acquisition, preservation, dissemination, and communication of information vital to the conduct of research work in all fields of human endeavor and on an international scale. (2) The complexity of the field of document reproduction today which has resulted from the enormous technical advances made in the past fifteen years. The need for the coining of the new class word - reprography (an unfortunate graft of a Latin fragment on a Greek root) - is in itself indicative of the great changes that have come about.  Processes and methods which formerly were discrete and distinctive have now become intricately interrelated. New processes and combinations of processes with different and astonishing capabilities continue to appear.  This revolution in the document copying field has been powerfully augmented by intensive competition on the part of manufacturers for a share of the vast and lucrative office-records copying field.  The results, however, have led to highly important applications in the reproduction of research materials as well.

This study is an attempt to submit to a critical analysis the main problems related to corporate headings, the difficulties raised by them and the solutions which now prevail in various countries. In order to make the differences existing between the various solutions and the unsatisfactory character revealed by many of them more evident, a great number of examples in a variety of languages, extracted from cataloguing codes, national bibliographies, printed lists of corporate headings have been added.  These examples are also intended to draw attention to differences existing with regard to various technical details, such as punctuation, capitalization, transliteration, etc. In addition, many of these examples will clearly prove that certain solutions which may be considered to be suitable for one country or one language would not satisfy the requirements of another country or another language. In the study, examination and analysis of codes has been complemented by references to professional literature on the subject available to the author, and by an analysis of opinions expressed there.  Special attention has been paid to comparisons of cataloguing practices and citation usages, and to investigations of the users' approach to corporate headings.  It is well understood and appreciated that, for the catalogue user, the identification of and search for corporate headings present more problems than any other type of heading.  Unfortunately, however, professional literature has as yet paid insufficient attention to these problems. \", '343': \"A Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge Kuhn, T.J. On almost all the occasions when we turn explicitly to the same problems, Sir Karl's view of science and my own are very nearly identical.  We are both concerned with the dynamic process by which scientific knowledge is acquired rather than with the logical structure of the products of scientific research.  Given that concern, both of us emphasize, as legitimate data the facts and also the spirit of actual scientific life, and both of us turn often to history to find them.  From this pool of shared data, we draw many of the same conclusions.  Both of us reject the view that science progresses by accretion; both emphasize instead the revolutionary process by which an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one; and both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the older theory's occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic, experiment, or observation.  Finally, Sir Karl and I are united in opposition to a number of classical positivism's most characteristic theses.  We both emphasize, for example, the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observation with scientific theory; we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts to produce any neutral observation language; and we both insist that scientists may properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena and that do so in terms of real objects, whatever the latter phrase may mean. \", '344': 'Current Problems in Reference Service Galvin, T.J.

The Ohio College Library Center is developing a computerized, user-oriented, library system that will improve efficiency of library use and operations; that will increase availability of library resources within a region; and that will facilitate evolution of new and easier accesses to information in libraries.  The center does not conceive of its task as being merely the mechanization of library procedures of the past. For the immediate future, the principal academic objective of the center is to increase the availability of library resources for use in educational and research programs in colleges and universities throughout Ohio.  A more distant objective is to enable libraries to participate actively in the programs of instruction and research in their institutions. The passive service functions that libraries have developed during the past century are proving inadequate to meet the present demands made of libraries, and will be increasingly inadequate in the future. The per-student costs of libraries are rising somewhat more than twice as rapidly as unit-cost rises in the general economy.  Therefore, the principal economic goal of the Ohio College Library Center is to decelerate the rate of rise of per-student costs, so that the rate of increase will approximate that of the economy as a whole.

Rather, the approach we take prescribes how an individual who is faced with a problem of choice under uncertainty should go about choosing a course of action that is consistent with his personal basic judgements and preferences.

Without new and effective efforts for their preservation, most will not be usable in their present form in the next century.

Similar dangers of destruction confront other cellulosic products, such as film, which may substitute for paper as the material base of records.  And not only research libraries are involved.

Modern American library history has received only sporadic attention as a subject for investigation.  Though we have now accumulated an adequate supply of source materials to draw upon in the form of annual reports, service studies, biographical accounts, and chronicles of individual libraries, no one has yet fashioned out of these materials a critical history of American librarianship.  To paraphrase Leo LaMontagne, we have salvaged remnants from the past, but we have yet to convert them into history. The lack has cost the profession dearly.  Even a casual survey of the literature of librarianship reveals the shocking degree of duplication and naivete that stem from an insufficient awareness of previous efforts. There is clearly room and need for a series of evaluative studies of the development of American library services which could eventually be put together to form the desired definitive history of American librarianship.

Today, statistical methods have so affected many disciplines that it is not unusual for doctoral programs to accept statistical techniques as a substitute for one foreign language.  Similarly, the ability to program in an appropriate language is also frequently as acceptable as French or German in providing the research skills needed by doctoral students at The City University of New York and at other universities.

The report is concerned with the social utility of libraries and with the factors that appear to be requirements for effective programs.  In the absence of established standards or criteria for measuring program effectiveness, we have substituted a comparative analysis of a number of programs based on detailed observation of the program process; a survey of needs and interests of the target groups, both users and nonusers; and an assessment of the library's role in the target neighborhood as it is perceived by other community institutions serving the same groups.  Thus a basis for comparisons and for judgements has been introduced which provides a foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programs of service to the disadvantaged might move. To achieve the study objectives, library programs and practices in low-income neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities. In each of fifteen cities data were collected through interview and observation in four subject areas: (1) the needs and interests of the community residents, (2) library services in relation to other available community resources, (3) the nature and scope of the neighborhood library program and its relation to the rest of the library system, and (4) available measures of the impact or effectiveness of the program. \", '359': 'Documentation Bradford, S.C. 1948 More than half a century ago La Fontaine and Otlet started their lives\\' work, which at first was connected with the term \"bibliography,\" but to which gradually the work \"Documentation\" was attributed.

The elements being transformed are then no longer restricted to mathematical symbols alone, but they may be words and phrases, books, documents, pictures, and other information carriers.  It is that more restricted interpretation of an information process which gives rise to the field of information science, concerned with the collection, analysis, classification, storage, retrieval, transmission, and dissemination of recorded data and intelligence.

How should the library allocate its book budget?  What kinds of books should it tend to buy?  What types of households use the library?  Why do some households not use the library?  What is the cost of the various services provided by the library?  What specific steps can the library take to improve its services?  What are the library's options in choosing among the different circulation systems?  For how long should the library allow books to be checked out?  How frequently should overdue notices be sent out?  Is an investment in a security system worthwhile? We have studied these questions in the context of one public library - the Beverly Hills (California) Public Library - and have developed a methodology for determining answers to them, as well as to other questions that arose during our investigation.  Although answers will vary from library to library, our methodology is quite general and should prove useful at many public libraries. \", '365': \"Economics of the Academic Libraries Baumol, W.J. This volume represents what we believe to be as complete and thorough an analysis as possible of the available economic data on college and university libraries.  In the course of our study, we have examined the data for comprehensiveness and consistency; we have investigated their intertemporal behavior, both as a basis for projection and as an instrument for long-range planning; and we have constructed a set of analytic interrelationships which permit us to derive statistical estimates of the interrelations of some of the most critical economic variables relating to library operations.  In particular, in the course of this last step, we have provided relationships explaining statistically the determination of such variables as the size of libraries' budgets and the magnitude of their professional staffs. \", '366': 'Economics of Approval Plans Spyersduran, P.

The timely topic of economics of approval plans of the Third International Conference on Approval and Gathering Plans for Large and Medium Size Academic Libraries, held at the Ramada Inn, West Palm Beach, Florida, February 17-19, 1971, has thus generated considerable interest. The papers published here constitute, by and large, original research in this area.  The importance of these contributions can hardly be overestimated, since they will no doubt mold and influence collection development practices in the current imprint area.

This report attempts to present and interpret current (Winter 1968-69) information on the economics of book storage in relation to the other factors a university administrator must consider in developing a program for housing an ever-growing book collection when there are present or future limitations on space and money. The study will attempt to answer two specific questions: 1) Is it economical for colleges and universities to select so-called little-used books from the regular bookstacks and store them elsewhere? 2) Is the cost factor the only one a university need consider in adopting a storage program; and, if not, how is cost related to the others? The facts and conclusions in this report are based on the library book storage situation as of 1969.  Innovations in computer applications and other technologies could presumably change the nature of some of the cost factors, but it is the author's opinion that these changes unlikely to occur within the next 5 to 10 years. \", '368': 'Economies and Computers Sharpe, W.F. It is not a simple matter to describe this book.  Briefly, it attempts to provide and apply a set of concepts from economic theory that may prove valuable to those who are now or may become decision- makers in the selection, financing, and/or use of computers.  Only theory relevant for such decision-makers is presented here.  This means that the effects of computers on the economy as a whole lie outside the scope of this book, as do a number of related issues.  We deal, thus, with microeconomic, not macroeconomic, theory: our focus is on the small (industry, firm, computer) and not the large (gross national product, consumer price index, unemployment).

The purpose of this book is to explain a way of looking at military problems which we and others with whom we have been associated have found fruitful in insights and productive of solutions.  Essentially we regard all military problems as, in one of their aspects, economic problems in the efficient allocation and use of resources.  We believe that this way of looking at military problems goes far toward reconciling the apparent conflict of views between the officers and officials who are responsible for defense and the officials and Congressmen whose primary interest is economy - except in determining the over-all size of the military budget, where conflict between these points of view is inevitable.

The exponential growth of the literature of science and technology is a phenomenon which scientists have been living with for the past 300 years. It is in the nature of such growth that its effect is recognized only slowly, but when a critical point is reached its consequences can be overwhelming. In science information this point has now been reached.  To take but one field, chemistry, it took well over two centuries for the first million papers to be published, and over 30 years, from 1907 to 1938, for the first million to be abstracted in Chemical Abstracts.  We are now at the stage where one million papers have been abstracted in a five-year period - 1962-1967 - and before 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers, equal to the output of the whole pre-war generation of chemists, will be published and abstracted in a single year. The first scientific serial began publication in 1665.  Some 290 years later, in 1956, the Science Museum Library was receiving 9,000 current scientific serials.  Within only a further 11 years the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (N.L.L.) was receiving over three times this number.  The growth in the use of scientific literature is no less spectacular.  Thus, for example, in 1930 the number of loans by the Science Museum Library was 10,000.  In 1967 the N.L.L., which had taken over the national lending function of the Science Museum Library, lent well over half-a-million items, a total exceeding that of all the loans by the Science Museum Library between 1929 and 1947 (a period which itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application for peaceful uses, enormous progress in antibiotics, developments in synthetic materials and great advances in all branches of science and technology). There are some signs that the rate of increase implied in these examples may not be maintained, but any flattening-out that may develop will be at a very high level indeed.

Librarians, publishers, and information system engineers have very little verified information and few guidelines to describe the user's specific requirements for information.  Such information is needed to properly design or evaluate the information systems.  To date, most of the statements of requirements have been rather subjective, and often reflect opinion rather than actual fact.  Relatively little objective data have been obtained.  This is probably due in large part to the fact that there are extremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine and state user requirements in a meaningful manner.  This paper suggests an approach or point of view that might help this situation by providing a method of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a more convenient and meaningful manner.  This paper also furnishes several examples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data that support these statements. In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirements of workers in the field of science and technology, with no serious attempt made to include workers in other fields.  However, it seems quite likely that the approach, and perhaps even the stated principles, could be extended and generalized to cover other fields of knowledge. \", '374': 'Electronic Data Processing in the University Library Pflug, G.

Among these organizations are publishers, computer software and time- sharing companies, micrographic firms, libraries, information centers, and consultants.  The common interest of these diverse organizations is in service based on storage and representation of structured information with output on a recurring or demand basis.  The concept of information as used throughout this book is defined as data organized into a collection of facts and most often recorded in two basic forms: 1) textual data or literature, and 2) numeric data. Roles played by the organizations described on the following pages vary but include one or more of the following functions: data base creation, data base publishing, data transmission, data manipulation and analysis, and data storage and retrieval.  Emphasis in this publication is on organizations involved in computerized services, micrographic applications, selective dissemination of information (SDI), and networking. Not included in the Encyclopedia of Information Systems and Services are printed commercial and legal services, traditional academic and special libraries, public information offices, hardware manufacturers and distributors within the computer and micrographic field, conventional indexing and abstracting services, and most library automation programs which are limited to such housekeeping functions as circulation, serials control, and acquisitions.

Citation indexing is a relatively new method of organizing the contents of a collection of documents in a way that overcomes many of the shortcomings of the more traditional indexing methods.  The primary advantage of citation indexing is that it identifies relationships between documents that are often overlooked in a subject index.  An important secondary advantage is that the compilation of citation indexes is especially well suited to the use of man-machine indexing methods that do not require indexers who are subject specialists.  Furthermore, citations, which are bibliographic descriptions of documents, are not vulnerable to scientific and technological obsolescence as are the terms used in subject indexes.

An alternative hypothesis to be investigated is that, to a considerable extent, the references are scattered throughout all periodicals with a frequency approximately related inversely to the scope.  On this hypothesis, the aggregate of periodicals can be divided into classes according to relevance of scope to the subject concerned, but the more remote classes will, in the aggregate, produce as many references as the more related classes.  The whole range of periodicals thus acts as a family of successive generations of diminishing kinship, each generation being greater in number than the preceding, and each constituent of a generation producing inversely according to its degree of remoteness. The investigation covered, in the first place, the references quoted, in the course of four and two and a-half years respectively, by the current bibliographies of Applied Geophysics and Lubrication, which are prepared in the library.

Externally, the cost of solid-state electronic devices has decreased almost as dramatically as their size.  This has stimulated the development of digital computers and peripheral devices and this, in turn, has caused a dramatic increase in the volume of data communicated between such machines.  The intolerance of computing systems to error, and in some cases the inherently critical nature of the data demand the use of either error-free facilities or some type of error-detecting or correcting code in the terminal devices.  In many cases the latter approach is the more economical. ', '381': 'The Evaluation of Information Services and Products King, D.W. The continuing need to put scientists in contact with the research of others, coupled with the rapidly expanding volume of published material during the past several decades, has placed new emphasis on the old arts of assembling, coding, and disseminating recorded knowledge.  In some instances, the emphasis has manifested itself in research on improvement of traditional library systems.  In other instances, it has resulted in the assembly of specialized collections and their intensive indexing for access in a variety of ways.  Still other systems have progressed from the passive role of responding to requests to the active role of supplying documents, or references to them, to researchers as the documents become available.  For lack of a more descriptive terminology, all of these activities are referred to in this book as \"document transfer systems,\" implying that the product being retrieved (or disseminated) is a document rather than the information (if any) in it.  That is, intelligence systems or fact retrieval systems (if facts are indeed retrieved) are excluded from our concern.

As new colleges and junior colleges are founded, and established colleges and universities continue to expand to meet growing educational needs, both groups of institutions find that in more and more instances the materials they need are available only in microform.

Those who seek to select for support the more promising plans and projects submitted to funding agencies have become habituated to the ritualistic inclusion in the proposal of a final section on Evaluation.  In most cases this section consists of sometimes grandiose but usually vague statements of intent and procedure for assessing the impact of the proposed action.

Formal and informal scientific communication are complementary; they must not be thought of as alternatives in the sense that, perhaps, certain messages are obtained exclusively through the printed word, the library, and the mechanized search-and-retrieval system, whereas others are obtained by the exclusive use of word-of-mouth and the telephone.  The much more typical event is one in which the receipt of a single message is secured by the successive interplay of these two kinds of communication.  For any given transaction between a scientist as a receiver of information and the channel that brings him that information usually has a history behind it and a future ahead of it that may be very relevant to the evaluation of the success of that transaction and to the prognosis of whether this kind of transaction will happen again with similar results.

The study is a result of a theory of librarianship which has been in the process of maturation for more than a quarter century of teaching and administration, first at the University of Chicago, and subsequently at Western Reserve University, now Case Western Reserve University, and which has been elaborated in essays and addresses as the inquiry progressed. My purpose has been to explore the role of the library as it contributes to the total communication system in society and the meaning of that role for the library profession, and having determined the requirements of that role to identify those which are appropriately met by graduate professional education.  Therefore, the inquiry begins with a consideration of the communication system within the individual as related to his physiological, neurological, and psychological structure, and its meaning for learning and reading patterns and characteristics.

For documentation and information retrieval in general, other techniques such as alphabetical indexing and machine selection are also available.  That classification is of value in information retrieval as well as in book arrangement is, however, made evident in two ways.  First, to achieve consistency and subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selection designers of such retrieval systems find the need to introduce classificatory techniques.  Second, there is a continuing demand for the construction of special classifications for detailed arrangement and cataloguing of documents in restricted but intensively cultivated fields of knowledge. It is to help meet these demands, particularly the second, that this guide has been prepared.  The techniques of detailed depth classification have been greatly developed during the past decade, and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than the traditional 'tree-of-knowledge' schemes can now be designed. These developments have been reported mainly as research papers in a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarily difficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology. There is a need for a more simply written and more readily available practical guide to the use of the newer techniques of classification. \", '389': \"Factors Determining the Performance of Indexing Systems Cleverdon, C.W.

The group of fifteen index languages which were based on concepts gave the worst performance, while a group of six index languages based on the Thesaurus of Engineering Terms of the Engineers Joint Council were intermediary.  Of the single term index languages, the only method of improving performance was to group synonyms and word forms, and any broader groupings of terms depressed performance.

The strong correlation between the scope and depth of this country's research and development activities and the vigor and the growth of its industrial plant is today a widely accepted fact.  Government expenditures for research and development have increased from a modest annual rate of $200 million some thirty years ago to $17 billion today. The research budgets of the private sector of the economy, which were almost miniscule in the 1930's, total approximately $8 billion today. These expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results, ranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics, but what is not so generally appreciated is the additional product represented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledge whose application, for the most part, is still a potential one.  The sophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products in which we engage today, which require vast research expenditures to find the efficient way, or the economical way, or the safe way, or the most accurate way to accomplish some end purpose, also produces an increase in the national level of scientific and technological competence that has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy.  The value of the technical ideas now stored and awaiting application can be estimated as a value many times larger than the annual rate of billions of dollars invested in the effort it took to develop this increased technical capability.

The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topics as normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered.  Four types of automata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described.  These automata are the finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linear bounded automaton, and the Turing machine.  The Turing machine is covered in detail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown.

How can formal channels be manipulated to take on the characteristics of informal communication?  To cast light on these questions the present paper examines the role of informal and formal channels within the overall system of scientific dissemination in psychology, considers the special advantages of informal communication, and outlines certain relations between informal and formal channels.  In a final section of the paper, two experiments in scientific communication are described; one experiment being built about an innovation that attempts to \"informalize\" formal channels while the other is built about another innovation that, in general, attempts to \"formalize\" an informal channel.

We do not claim that any particular question has been answered here in a definitive way, but the conception of a generative system based on an articulation of the semantic relation (see Section 1.3.4) may perhaps be interesting in connection with the present development of algebraic linguistics. This conception originated in 1963-1964, mainly as a reaction to the existing form of transformational description.  It has not yet been possible to take the more recent impulses into account to an extent that would be adequate to their scope and theoretical significance.  Only some aspects of these impulses are commented on in the relevant parts of the present book.

Concomitant with this development is the proliferation of published directives, regulations, reports, technical studies, and other informational issuances in such volume that no one engaged in a business or profession, no financial tycoon, educator, researcher, farmer, housewife, welfare recipient, or unemployed person can function without some reference to government publications.  Yet, in few areas of recorded human knowledge have control and bibliographic aids been so little systemized. The present work, designed to provide the prospective user as well as the trained researcher and librarian with a guide to the maze, is a direct descendant of the Childs essay.  The extent to which the mass of published material has grown is underscored by the contrasting physical size of the two publications; Childs' was a 78-page pamphlet containing approximately 400 entries whereas this book of over 400 pages cites more than 3,000 titles. \", '404': 'A Guide to the Library of Congress Classification Immroth, J.P. This guide is an introduction to the Library of Congress Classification; as such, it does not include instructions for every subclass or table, but attempts to provide the reader with an understanding of the characteristics of the classification, the arrangement within the classes, the format of the schedules and tables, and special problems of use and notation.  The reader should trace the analysis of each example of classing through the pages from the L.C. schedule provided in the guide.  It is important to remind the reader that a thorough study of each class schedule in addition to the recommended readings is essential.  The author realizes that many imperfections may be present in this guide and will appreciate suggestions for changes from readers. ', '405': 'Guide to Reference Books Winchell, C.M. The fundamental principles of reference work remain more or less constant through the years, but the rapid expansion of the publication of reference books in all fields makes essential a careful selection to fit the needs of each library.  The purpose of this volume is to list reference books basic to research - general and special - and thus to serve as: (1) a reference manual for the library assistant, research worker, or other user of library resources; (2) a selection aid for the librarian; and (3) a textbook for the student, who, either in library school, training class, or college course in bibliography, is pursuing a systematic study of reference books. The needs of these types of users have influenced the organization and make-up of this volume, in that the requirements of the first two groups have made the manual more comprehensive than it might have been if intended for a textbook only, while the introductions to sections and many of the annotations have been provided particularly for the library school student.

This book is one of the products of a contract initiated by the Automation Task Force of the Federal Library Committee, sponsored and monitored by the U.S. Office of Education, and carried out by the System Development Corporation.  The project included a questionnaire survey of all Federal libraries (2104), as of December, 1970, to gather systems planning data and to identify Federal libraries with operational or planned automated systems. Respondents in the latter group were sent a Federal Library Automation Survey questionnaire requesting specific details about existing and planned systems. From these sources, amplified by visits to Federal libraries and an extensive review of the automation literature, information was distilled for use in this Handbook.

The first part, written by myself, deals with 'Comparative librarianship and comparative method' and is intended for both teachers of comparative librarianship and their students.  It can be approached in a number of ways:  The first three chapters outline comparative librarianship and the theoretical basis of its methodology against the wider background of other comparative sciences and the scientific method.  The three chapters following are purely practical and explain the various steps of writing a comparative study.  The last chapter is intended for teachers. The second part, compiled by Mrs. MacKee, is a bibliographical guide to the main sources on librarianship throughout the world. It draws on the bibliographies collected by comparative librarianship students in the course of their project work, on replies to a questionnaire sent to the various library associations of the world, and on Mrs. MacKee's own collection of references gathered over a number of years. \", '408': 'Handbook of Data Processing for Libraries Hayes, R.M. 1970 The purpose of this book, therefore, is to assist libraries and librarians in resolving some of the problems faced in utilizing this new technology.  The intent is to provide a concrete, factual guide to the principles and methods available for the application of modern data processing to library operations. For the operating librarian, it should be considered a handbook, a tool to guide him in decisions concerning the introduction of data processing techniques into his own library.  For the student, it should be a textbook, educating him not only in methodology but also in the interrelationships between data processing and the library.  For the system designer, it should be a summary of the state-of-the-art, serving as a bridge between library objectives and the technology.  The book, throughout, lays special stress on the library and, particularly, on the significance of library values and policies for determining the choice of system.  The book gives emphasis to the computer, but always in the context of applying this technology to the solution of operating problems, as an addition to resources for information service, as a tool of good management, and not as an end in itself.  At most, therefore, the book aims to educate the profession in the use of these tools, and in the special problems of applying them to libraries.  In this respect, much of the groundwork has already been done - the profession has been educating itself, has carried out analyses of library operations, has experimented with mechanization, and is developing better concepts of cost control.  The book merely continues a process that is already underway. ', '409': \"HDB of Data Processing for Libraries Hayes, R.M. The four years since the first edition of this book was published have been a period of exceptional advance in the usage of computers in libraries.  Where one or two examples were all that were available at that time to illustrate each kind of application, now there are five to ten; where the cadre of knowledgeable people in libraries at that time was small, now virtually every major library has some kind of systems department; where the efforts at that time were largely experimental and developmental, now there is a wealth. This second edition has therefore been written in a context totally different from that of the first. But its aims are the same; to ensure that practicing librarians and that students in library schools approach the world of automation with knowledge of its capabilities and limitations and with the techniques of systems analysis by which to analyze and evaluate alternative answers to the library's processing problems.  The changes from the first edition therefore represent not a departure from that purpose but simply an updating of its content, to reflect the advances and experience gained, and an opportunity to correct the errors (hopefully minor) that have been found through use of the first edition. \", '410': 'Handbook of Medical Library Practice Annan, G.L. The Medical Library Association has long been aware of the need for a third edition of the Handbook.  Changes in library practices, proliferating demands upon established libraries, and the development of new ones created the need of an up-to-date tool.  Like the earlier editions, this Handbook is such a tool, a manual, not a survey of the state of the art.  It offers practical advice to all - fledgling librarians starting their careers, experienced librarians transferring to the field of health sciences, established medical librarians refreshing memories or adopting procedures unfamiliar to them, and specialists in related fields.

Two methods were used:  (1) A thorough search of professional literature, principally since 1965, with exceptions in cases where no later information was available, and (2) direct communication with associations through a questionnaire and consultation of supplementary material provided by the associations. The final result of the authors' search was a total of 319 library associations, 33 international in scope and 286 national (see Statistical Data). \", '412': \"The Hidden Dimension Hall, E.T. Generally speaking, there are two types of books of interest to the serious reader today:  those that are content oriented, designed to convey a particular body of knowledge, and those that deal with structure, the way in which events are organized.  It is doubtful if an author has any control over which of these two types of books he writes, though it is desirable that he be aware of the difference.  The same applies to the reader whose satisfaction depends largely on his unstated expectations.  In today's world, when all of us are overwhelmed with data from many sources, it is easy to understand why people are apt to feel that they are losing touch with developments even in their own field.  One senses that there is also a growing awareness of a loss of relatedness to the world at large.  This loss of relatedness leads to an increased need for organizing frames of reference to aid in intergrating the mass of rapidly changing information with which man must cope. The Hidden Dimension attempts to provide just this. \", '413': 'Historical Introduction to Library School White, C.M. This is a revision and enlargement of Origins of the American Library School. Someone has observed that the roots of the present lie deep in the past and must be uncovered to understand fully how the present came to be what it is.  This study is less a descriptive history of library schools and their work than a search for perspective within which major problems, as well as the course pursued in resolving them, can be more fully understood.  The original study, begun in 1941-42, sought to throw light on how library education at that time came to be what is was.  The present study continues beyond the early forming of the American library school to the reforming of basic lines of policy and organization.  A new title is used to reflect the broadened scope.

The book is intended for the student of library science or of cultural history and for the general reader interested in the development of western civilization.  Much has been omitted concerning libraries and librarians that could have been included; conversely, some facts could have been omitted without seriously detracting from the story as a whole but have been included to illustrate how library history developed; they point out the high spots and indicate trends.

Nearly twenty-five years ago it occurred to me that we might gain considerable insight into the mainsprings of human behavior if we viewed it purely as a natural phenomenon like everything else in the universe, and if we studied it with the same dispassionate objectivity with which one is wont to study, say, the social behavior of bees, or the nestbuilding habits of birds.  The present book reports the results of the extended inquiry that ensued in the course of those years, and which led to the disclosure of some fundamental principles that seem to govern important aspects of our behavior, both as individuals and as members of social groups.

The tasks discussed are short (half-hour), moderately difficult problems of a symbolic nature.  The three main tasks we use - chess, symbolic logic, and algebra-like puzzles (called cryptarithmetic puzzles) - typify this class of problems.  The study is concerned with the integrated activities that constitute problem solving.  It is not centrally concerned with perception, motor skill, or what are called personality variables. The study is concerned primarily with performance, only a little with learning, and not at all with development or differences related to age. Finally, it is concerned with integrated activities, hence deemphasizes the details of processing on the time scale of elementary reactions (that is, half a second or less).  Similarly, long-term integrated activities extending over periods of days or years receive no attention. ', '418': 'The Human Side of Enterprise McGregor, D. This volume is an attempt to substantiate the thesis that the human side of enterprise is \"all of a piece\" - that the theoretical assumptions management holds about controlling its human resources determine the whole character of the enterprise.  They determine also the quality of its successive generations of management. Of course the process is circular, and herein lies the possibility and the hope of future progress.  The key question for top management is:  \"What are your assumptions (implicit as well as explicit) about the most effective way to manage people?\"  From the answer to this question flow the answers to the questions Mr. Sloan raised in our discussion about the making of managers, as well as answers to many other questions which perplex and confound management as it seeks to achieve more successfully the economic objectives of enterprise.  It will be clear to the reader that I believe many of our present assumptions about the most effective way to manage people are far from adequate. ', '419': 'A Statistical Approach to Mechanized Encoding and Searching of Literary Information Luhn, H.P. Written communication of ideas is carried out on the basis of statistical probability in that a writer chooses that level of subject specificity and that combination of words which he feels will convey the most meaning.. Since this process varies among individuals and since similar ideas are therefore relayed of different levels of specificity and by means of different words, the problem of literature searching by machines still present major difficulties.. A statistical approach  to this problem will be outlined and the various steps of a system based on this approach will be described.. Steps include the statistical analysis of a collection of document in a field of interest, the establishment of a set of \"notions\" and the vocabulary by which they are expressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary, the encoding of topological notations (such as branches structures), the recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines to carry out a search..

An automatic system is being developed to disseminate information to the various sections of any industrial, scientific or government organization.. This intelligence system will utilize data-processing machines for auto- abstracting and auto-encoding of documents and for creating interest profiles for each of the \"action points\" in an organization.. Both incoming and internally generated documents are automatically abstracted, characterized by a word pattern, and sent automatically to appropriate action points..

Normally, some process of generalization is used to compress the data so that it can be analyzed more easily.. A primitive step in this process is the \"clustering\" technique, which involves gathering together similar data into a cluster to permit a significant generalization..

The analytical problems of developing quantitative techniques for R & D investment management are often complicated by the existence of conflicting goals.. Corporate goals may require the R & D  manager to simultaneously seek the highest probable profits, the largest probable number of successes, and the greatest probable profit per dollar spent.. Departmental goals may restrict the manager to some maximum budget, a minimum number of projects to be worked on, and minimum levels of accomplishment on specific projects.. In a sense, then, the research manager is faced with a constrained multiple-output production problem: how much to spend on which project and how much to spend overall.. This  paper shows how a slight modification of Hess' approach to project selection  and an analogy to the theoretical economics of a multiple-product factory have been used to help our research management simultaneously solve these project selection, resource allocation, and budget determination problems..

A flow model is presented which identifies some of the organizational factors influencing idea generation behavior in industrial R&D laboratories.. The model is constructed from literature-based propositions which make explicit the role played by several organizational factors identified in the model.. Data were collected on about 300 ideas created in a divisional laboratory of a major U.S. corporation.. In general, these data support the a priori propositions.. Further, data analysis suggests that two pieces of information are required before an idea is generated: 1) knowledge of a need, problem, or opportunity relevant to the company; and, 2) knowledge of a means or technique for satisfying the need, solving the problem, or capitalizing on the opportunity.. These results are discussed with respect to the stage of creative thought proposed by other investigators..

Models and techniques to aid management in planning controlling R&D projects frequently use subjective probability of success forecasts as one of the major inputs.  An experiment was conducted at the research laboratories of Monsanto Company to measure the predictive validity and consistency of such forecasts. The results indicate that the eventual success or failure of certain types of R&D projects can be predicted by measuring the time shape of polled probability of success forecasts.  Probability of success forecasts appear to yield more valid advance warning indicators than several commonly used project status measures.  These results tend to support the hypothesis that R&D planning and control models that are based on subjective probability estimates may reliably be used by management to aid in early identification of eventually failing projects, as well as to aid in project selection and project funding.

Since many alerting and information services rely very heavily on the use of titles to transfer information to the potential user, it is essential that he be aware of the proportion of the information contained in the complete document which will not be deducible from the title and which he will therefore miss.. Methods will be discussed for analyzing the relative information content of the titles of engineering paper and results presented for the amount and type of information lost through scanning title listing only.. Between one-third and one-half of indexable terms are not retrievable from article titles even if all possible synonyms and  related terms are used.. If all synonyms are used instead of one keyword the amount of information retrieved is increased by about 70 percent.. The problems of dealing with synonyms and with syntactical variants in searching titles indexes are discussed..

The motivation for this investigation derived from a series of visits to institutions which were deeply committed to the design, development, and operation of non-traditional automated information systems.  At the time of the visits, the systems seemed to be working technically but, paradoxically, they did not appear to have made a significant impact on the respective user communities.  Although few people associated with the systems openly expressed concern, there were non-verbal indicators which suggested that some people were becoming nervous. Since all of the systems represented high expenditures of time and money, a feeling of uneasiness seemed quite appropriate.

For us the question of whether Hamilton or Madison wrote the disputed Federalist papers has served as a laboratory and demonstration problem for developing and comparing statistical methods.

The point of departure in this paper is the definition of a language, L, as a fuzzy relation from a set of terms, T = {x}, to a universe of discourse, U = {y}.. As a fuzzy relation, L is characterized by its membership function mL:T*U -> [0,1], which associates with each ordered pair (x,y) its grade of membership, mL(x,y), in L.. Given a particular x in T, the membership function mL(x,y) defines a fuzzy set, M(x), in U whose membership function is given by mM(x)(y) = mL(X,y).. The fuzzy set M(x) is defined to be the meaning of the term x, with x playing the role of a name for M(x).. If a term x in T is a concatenation of other terms in T, that is, x = x1 ... xn, xi  T, i epsilon 1,...,n, then the meaning of x can be expressed in terms of the meanings of x1,...,xn through the use of a lambda-expression or by solving a system of equations in the membership functions of the xi which are deduced from the syntax tree of x..

The purpose of this paper is to propose and defend a definition of what it means to say that a piece of stored information is \"relevant\" to the information need of a retrieval system user.. The suggested definition explicates relevance in terms of logical implication.. For one yes-or-no question answering system which operates with one of the standard formalized languages, the definition provides a mathematically precise criterion of relevance..

Two recent articles in this journal (Konigova [1], Cooper [2]) have gone beyond the usual slapdash use of the words \"relevant\" and \"relevance,\" and have attempted to explicate the concept further.  Both attempts only partially succeed.  Konigova proposes three types:  formal relevance, subject/content relevance and subjective relevance (or pertinency).  This classification has validity, but is not further elaborated, and indeed she reverts to a less precise language; for example, in defining \"second order noise,\" she uses the ambiguous phrase \"a formally relevant document which is not really relevant\" - presumably meaning not subjectively relevant, according to the real need of the enquirer.  And in her mathematics, as she admits, \"no account is taken of the subjective relevance (pertinence).\"  Yet this is surely the true aim of the system.

The graph theoretical cluster which were developed from six data base under two different cluster definition were analyzed for average size and related data.. The clusters were also used to expand the queries in each of six data bases to determine the effect of the expansions on the document retrieval results.. Although a large variety of clusters and associated query explanations were obtained, no significant improvements in the document retrieval performance were achieved.. In some cases, however, significant degradations in the retrieval performance occurred.. Although seemingly meaningful clusters can be obtained, the results indicate that the effort involved in finding clusters and adding the clustered terms to queries is far to great to warrant their use in an operational system.. The data bases employed were relatively small, and the  authors caution against generalizing these results to large data bases or other  situations..

Situationally relevant items of information are those that answer, or logically help to answer, questions of concern.. Significant situationally relevant information is explained in terms of changes of view in relation to questions of concern..

In the present case it would not have been considered at all but for the kindly initiative of my respected friend Professor Roman Jakobson, whose persistent encouragement alone overcame that distaste which most of us feel for our ten- to twenty-year-old productions and brought this first volume to the point of no return.  It is true that these exploratory papers were scattered among an unconscionably awkward selection of publications for anyone wanting to follow them up.  On the other hand, as most of them were written for specific occasions, each of which demanded some rehearsal of points covered in earlier essays, the resulting repetitiveness presented a special problem.  With occasional exceptions, redundancy could have been eliminated only at the cost of mutilating individual papers.  The solution adopted has been to leave almost all repetitive passages intact, offsetting in small print those that can be skipped without loss by readers of the earlier chapters.

A substantial program engine has been developed which computes similarities between pairs of terms on the basis of their occurrences and co-occurrences in document descriptions, and finds classes of terms with strong similarity connections by minimizing the cohesion between a potential clump and its complement; and which retrieves using single terms and/or term classes according to specification, and calculates recall and precision ratios for sets of requests..

An articulated subject index is one in which logical transformations of natural language phrases containing prepositions or connectives are employed to organize the noun phrases as subject headings, with subordinate displays of the remainder of the phrases..

It has been shown that a well-defined transformation links the entry, as it appears in the index, with the original phrase, in natural order, as it was first compiled by the indexer.. A reverse transformation can be used to generate potential index entries from indexing phrases containing one or more prepositions or connectives.. A simple model has been devised for the generation of articulated subject index entries from natural language indexing phrases which exclude infinitives or words acting as gerunds or participles..

A study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevance assessments on the average recall and precision values used to measure retrieval effectiveness.. Using a collection of 1200 documents in information science for test purposes, it is found that large scale differences in the relevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall and precision..

The extent of these errors is expressed by the familiar measures of performance, precision and recall.  Precision measures the failure of the system to retrieve only relevant documents while recall measures its failure to retrieve all relevant documents actually present in the data base.

It was a substantial effort - half a million dollars is no small sum in the social sciences - made possible by an Urban Renewal Demonstration Grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to The City University of New York.  The proposal that initiated the Project in 1965 grew out of the extensive dissatisfaction with bibliographic services in planning librarianship at a time when both planners and librarians were looking to data processing to solve a variety of information problems. URBANDOC was to apply the techniques of scientific documentation to a body of literature which had been neglected by the information science community before the advent of computerization, and completely by-passed by it afterwards.

Many of the large-scale mechanized information systems in operation today grew up because of the need of the military and para-military establishments to have rapid access to large quantities of scientific and technological information.  This paper will deal with two complementary efforts in the field of social sciences, where an awareness of the information problem is acute, and the global needs staggering.  The target audiences for these two systems are on the one hand social science researchers and on the other policy planners and makers in the broad field of economic and social development. An operational system (in the International Labour Office) will be described, and an array of figures representing actual or theoretical operating costs will be given.  As could be expected, however, these figures relate only to costs of systems development, input preparation, file maintenance and retrieval.  No attempt can be made to evaluate in other than general terms the economic impact that the existence of such a system may have.  It can be readily demonstrated, however, that computer-assisted information systems may make sense within individual institutional environments, and make greater sense when on-line systems linking various collaborating institutions can result in enabling each to operate more efficiently and at lower cost.  The existence of such on-line networks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibility of having access at a reasonable price to large information stores.

This article reports on several experiments in automatic extracting and one experiment in automating indexing.. Nine chapters, each from a different technical book, were used as a text corpus for all the experiments.. In the first experiment, an attempt was made to construct a sentence dictionary of syntactic sentence types, for distinguishing extract-worthy sentences, but it proved unrewarding.. Nevertheless, the results indicated that sentence typing might be used in a screening process in conjunction with other extracting techniques.. The later attempts to combine synactic and statistical criteria in the choice of extract sentences and index phrases proved more rewarding.. The sentences selected  by the extracting algorithm  were representative and are presented for the reader to peruse.. The noun phrases selected by the indexing algorithm compared favorably with the back-of-the-book index phrases..

', '500': 'Cost-Effectiveness as a Guide in Developing Indexing Rules Schultz, Claire K. To date, the many decisions among alternatives that are required in the course of developmental efforts to improve indexing have, with few exceptions, been guided primarily by criteria related to effectiveness, as measured by some objective method, or as judged subjectively.. Although effectiveness-type criteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance the state-of-the-art, when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriate for operating services, it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion that takes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration.. The central problem of operating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexing possible at a given cost, or that of producing indexing of a given level of effectiveness at least cost.. In our current effort to develop rules for human, machine, and man-machine indexing, we employ a cost-effectiveness type of criterion in making the critical developmental decision.. The general approach is described  and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and of effectiveness  were considered jointly in decision making, primarily for how to reduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness.. Problems of defining cost are also discussed, such as how to divide indexing into discrete steps, the effects of long-term vs. short-term activity in humans and small-batch vs. large-batch considerations for machines..

Thus far, in our experiments on the physics literature, automatic classification has proven to be as good as or better than manual indexing and, in addition, potentially less expensive.. Empirically derived, our method is based upon a pattern discovery algorithm which use only the citation content of a document and with operates on the bibliographic links among papers..

The selectivity, timeliness and quality of indexing of a commercial service may be assessed by comparing the journal articles chosen by an organization as relevant to its interests, with those subsequently reported by the service.. These aspects were evaluated with respect to Drugdoc which scans over 3400 biomedical journals.. The results showed that the selection criteria laid down by Drugdoc are strictly adhered to; the mean time of alerting of an article was 11-3 weeks after receipt of the journal at Wellcome and all articles from a particular journal issue were reported by Drugdoc on average within 13-6 weeks.. Indexing was examined in detail and on average 8-1 primary thesaurus-controlled indexing terms were assigned per article..

Retrospective search of large document data bases requires development of special techniques for automatic compression of data and minimization of the number of input-output operations to the computer accessible files.. Also, the computer program should be designed to require a relatively small amount of internal memory.. The present paper contains a description of the structure of a program that meets the above requirements.. The vocabulary of the data base is automatically expressed in terms of 8, 16 and 24 bit codes chosen to point to the natural spelling in a dictionary.. Thus file size is reduced without the necessity for extensive processing for decoding.. Use of a compressed bit string inverted index greatly reduces search time, and a storage management system enables long strings to be processed with use of a limited amount of internal storage.. Creation of \"reduced\" files and tables is an important feature of a program; it allows the files needed only by specific phases of the program to be designed to use a relatively small amount of internal storage and input-output time..

Condensations in the form of logical jumps, or the omission of a concept with one relation out of a string of three concepts with two interstitial relations, have been investigated by two different methods, in order to overcome one of these technicalities.. Thirty-two rules are proposed which could permit the automatic condensation of either of both the stored information and the question, when the concepts and relations are in the form of linear or string display..

In our evaluation, two measures of cost were employed: a computer processing charge expressed in dollars, and the number of documents retrieved (a measure of work that must be expended to review the retrieved items).. The measure of performance was an estimate of the recall ratio.. To obtain the requisite measures an experimental plan was developed in which experts searched the data base of Psychological Abstracts forming their queries from written statements of information needs.. These statements (along with the list of documents relevant to them) were produced by people with information problems.. Tallies were kept of the number of documents retrieved before each of the designed relevant items were found.. The major findings are noted below..

Sumner At the IFLA Liverpool Conference in 1971 a Joint working Group of the Committees on Cataloguing and on Serial Publications was set up to draw up an International Standard Bibliographic Description for Serials, taking the ISBD(M) as a model in so far as practicable.  As might be expected, the special problems presented by serial publications made the task of developing an ISBD(S) a difficult assignment which the Joint Working Group tackled with great energy and devotion.  The successive drafts were prepared by the Chairman and the Secretary, Mlle M.-L. Bossuat and Mlle M. Pelletier. Probably no data element presented such a severe problem as that of serial title.  The seemingly countless Mitteilungen, Memoires, Proceedings, Bulletins, Trudy\\'s, and the like seemed to demand some useful and standardized way to be identified.  A solution to this problem was found in the adoption of a device which consisted of marrying the author statement to the generic title proper, with a wedding ring consisting of a space-hyphen- space and dubbing the happy couple the \"distinctive title.\" ', '542': '(Towards a Theory of the Concept) Dahlberg, I. A concept is regarded as the common element of both classification systems and thesauri.  Reality and knowledge are not represented by words or terms but by the meanings \"behind\" these tokens. A concept of, say, an object, a property of an object, a process, etc. is derived from verbal statements on these as subjects and may therefore be defined as the whole of true and possible predicates that can be collected on a given subject.  It is from these predicates that the characteristics of the corresponding concepts can be derived.  Common characteristics in different concepts lead to relations between concepts, which relations in turn are factors for the formation of concept systems. Different kinds of relationships as well as different kinds of concepts are distinguished.  It is pointed out that an orderly supply of the elements for propositions (information statements) on new knowledge requires the construction and availability of such concept systems.

How are scientific publications utilized by scientists? What is accomplished by the circulation of scientific information on an informal basis? How does the social organization among scientists facilitate or inhibit these processes? Three types of studies have been conducted in this area: (a) studies of the scientific literature itself; (b) studies of how scientists obtain the information which they need for their research; and (c) studies of the relationship between scientists who conduct research in the same areas.. For the most part, studies of formal communication and information gathering have been conducted in the absence of all but the most rudimentary theoretical models, as has been pointed out in at least three recent reviews of these studies (Libbey and Zaltman, 1967, p. 64; Paisley, 1968; Storer, 1968, p. 12).. The lack of theory can be attributed partly to the practical orientation of many of the studies and also to the fact that an adequate model cannot be based on any one of these types of studies alone..

In one broad category of theories, the problems are expressed in terms of actualities of events in group relations as they exist in everyday life.  On the whole, theories advanced by many social scientists fall in this broad category.  In this concern over actualities the problem is frequently not stated and discussion not developed in a way that can be tested rigorously. In the second broad category of theories, problems are stated and analysis carried out in terms of more rigorous-appearing concepts and units of analysis.  Theories coming from psychologists and social scientists heavily influenced by them fall within this broad category.  In this line of approach, theories are advanced without due regard to actualities, and consequently they are plagued with serious questions of validity.

This number is growing exponentially.  Large libraries report that they cannot fill about a third of the interlibrary loan requests they receive.  Unfilled interlibrary loans are costly to both the borrowing and the lending libraries and reduce the usefulness of the service to the reader.  Many of these interlibrary loan failures are preventable, chiefly by publishing policies of the lending libraries to prevent borrowers from requesting noncirculating materials and by determining in advance what library owns the item wanted. ', '551': 'Interlibrary Loan Policies Directory Thomson, S.K. In 1972-73 approximately 194,000 interlibrary loan requests were not filled because the borrowing library in ignorance requested non-circulating material contrary to the interlibrary lending policies of the lending library.  These unfilled requests probably cost the borrowing and lending libraries over $400,000 in wasted manpower, besides disappointing readers who waited in vain for their materials. Much of this waste could be prevented if borrowing libraries check in advance the lending policies before sending requests. The major elements determining whether or not libraries receive requests to borrow from libraries at a distance are whether the library lists unusual materials in union lists, especially THE NATIONAL UNION CATALOG, THE UNION LIST OF SERIALS AND NEW SERIAL TITLES, and whether it has strong collections in a subject field listed in library directories. Volume of out-of-state lending is related to the type of lending library, the size of collection, budget for current acquisitions, number of periodicals received, photocopy charges, population density in neighboring states, proximity to other libraries, and completeness of reporting holdings in the National Union Catalog or other bibliographic centers.

Accordingly, our data are presented in those forms and with those statistical measures appropriate to the methods of descriptive statistics: arrays, frequency distributions, breakdowns by categories which seem of optimum value to the librarian and administrator, e.g., the frequency of requests for journals versus monographs, the age of journals requested, the types and ages of materials requested by the various types of libraries (university, pharmaceutical, etc.).

Librarianship classifies as a social science because the library, as an institution, is a creature of society, and its goal is the improvement of society by helping the individual to understand himself and the world of which he is a part.  But the library is also concerned with man as a rational being.  Thus, it remains primarily a humanistic enterprise.  The traditional lines of demarcation among the disciplines are breaking down and in certain areas becoming almost obliterated; and librarianship, in both its technology and its services, is drawing ever closer to the social and physical sciences.  But we would do well to remind ourselves of the library's humanistic origins; otherwise, in excessive enthusiasm for the technology of science and the social action of the behaviorist, we may lose sight of the individual and his needs and the humanistic values implicit in them. \", '556': 'Introduction to Subject Indexing; a Programmed Text Brown, A.G.

All this has changed: as Michael Befoff comments in his book The Plateglass Universities (having made the foregoing points and more besides), what were once ivory towers have now become goldfish bowls. He goes on to give the obvious explanation for the change: universities are of public interest because they are now almost wholly supported by the taxpayers' money.  They represent a massive investment on the part of the government, and consequently are expected to yield a vitally important return in trained and educated manpower. Over the last twenty years government expenditure in this country on universities has risen from four million pounds a year to more than two hundred million pounds a year.

Contemporary models of research and development are incomplete in that they ignore the many reappraisals and budgeting decisions that occur in the time between a project's proposal and its commercialization.. The sequential decision aspects of project budgeting are particularly important since 1) the research expenditure is usually an order of magnitude less than the irrevocable investment for commercialization and 2) an allocation to a project today does not presuppose continuation of the project into future periods.. The research and development budgeting problem is structured to take into account the sequential decision characteristic.. Utilizing the technique of dynamic programming, methods are developed to determine optimal project budgets when the aggregate research and development budget is either constrained or unconstrained..

Edmund This paper describes an all computer document retrieval system which can find documents related to a request even though they may not be indexed by the exact terms of the request, and can present these documents in the order of their relevance to the request..

With proper manipulation of these associations (entirely within the machine) a vocabulary of synonyms, near synonyms and other words closely related to any given term or group of terms is derived.. Such a vocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much more powerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been available heretofore..

Together with the increasing shortage of qualified abstracts, the factors of time, cost and value have lent impetus to a trend toward the automatic generation of abstracts and indexes.. This trend has caused increased emphasis to be placed on the abstract as the locus of data for automatic retrieval systems.. This necessitates the creating of high quality abstracts..

It is necessary to analyze the conditions under which various methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to develop criteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract.. But clearly, an abstract can be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant to the abstract.. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the most significant contribution of this paper.. Methods of sentence selection and rejection are discussed.. These include contextual inference, intersentence reference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations.. The automatic abstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, called the Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functions specified for each WCL entry..

This is estimated to be 20-25% but can vary with subject and type of information sought.. If a search of, say, Chemical Titles is made, ignoring synonyms but allowing for all syntactical variants, only about one third of the significant information will be recovered.. Synonyms and other nomenclature problems are discussed.. Delay times and time of use are the two most important factors in evaluating an alerting service and are reviewed for some typical services..

A librarian attempting to do a literature search currently faces an eight-month gap in access to the literature of his field through Library Literature.  In April 1968, librarians made a rare examination of their own literature and considered this gap and other information problems in librarianship.  The Albany Conference on the Bibliographic Control of Library Science Literature recommended the establishment of a fast announcement service for library schools (1).  A monthly Keyword in Context (KWIC) index serving the whole range of information-oriented professions was a specific proposal which was favored by one conference group to meet the need for current information (2).

The state of the art literature review disclosed that society has not yet come to the point that paying for library information services is a common thing.. It was also found that a sound basis for determining the costs of the services - let alone charge for them - does not exist: While some data on specific cost for unit operations are available, it is very difficult to compare the data and arrive at meaningful figures.. Nevertheless, there is an indication that large operating centers are becoming concerned with cost to the point that they are cost-according their operations, which would permit them to establish realistic fees for their services..

The fundamental character of the phenomena is evidenced in the operations executed during the processing and communication functions.. The role of the metascience is dictated by several factors, namely, the need for a common basis upon which all information- oriented specialized sciences and technologies can be understood and studied, a common framework and language for all scientists and technologists concerned in some form or other with information on one side and man's relationship to the phenomena on the other side..  The content of the postulated metascience of information is circumscribed by a list of specific questions and problems for which the science has to provide answers and solutions..

Problems arising in the measurement of the rates of obsolescence of the sets of periodicals taken by special libraries are discussed.. The relatively large errors that arise in sampling the negative exponential distribution are analyzed because they may account for some of the discrepancies reported and because they indicate the need for firmer statistical control of work on obsolescence than has yet been generally appreciated.. When the rate of decline has been satisfactorily established there still remains the problem of deciding how to apply it.. Issues of those periodicals that contribute most productively should be retained for a longer period than those of periodicals that contribute less.. To solve this problem the concept of \"utility contours\" is introduced and exemplified in the design of a p% library.. It is argued that no discarding policy is likely to be generally applicable; every special library must be regarded as a special case.  Rather than suggest new measurements, therefore, the paper offers simple graphical techniques that are applicable to any other special case..

Two groups of journals were identified as potential sources for cardiovascular (c-v) information.. The first group consists of 78 c-v specialty journals, identified as cardiovascular from the title.. These 78 emanate from 24 countries, with about one-half of the specialty journals being published by 28 national and international societies.. The second group of journals is composed of those journals used by grantees of the National Heart Institute (NHI) to publish their findings.. In fiscal 1967, 5,860 papers, appearing in 789 journals, were reported to NHI.. Taking the grantees of NHI as being representative of U.S. c-v researchers, it was found that the specialty journals were not the most quantitatively fertile sources of c-v information - only about 14% of American c-v papers were published there.. The remaining 86% of the literature was widely dispersed throughout 766 nonspecialty c-v journals.. The extent of bibliographic control by the major indexing and abstracting services was found to be more extensive for the top-ranking journals in the NHI sample than for the group of c-v specialty journals..

The efficiency of key-work-in-context (KWIC) permuted-title indexes and their numerous variations is highly dependent upon authors\\' choices of titles for their papers.. Titles are important not only in commercial services, such as Chemical Titles, BASIC, Current Contents, and CA Condensates, but also in scanning primary journals, and in traditional library services, such as bibliographies.. It is generally believed and often stated that titles of chemical papers are becoming more informative as authors become increasingly aware of the importance of titles as \"carriers\" of information.. The present study was undertaken to test whether (1) titles of chemical papers are becoming more informative and (2) whether uninformative titles of chemical papers are being eliminated since the advent of the KWIC index in 1958.. The first hypothesis was tested by comparing titles published in 1948, 1958, and 1968 by the following criteria: (1) a count of substantive words in the title; (2) a count of all word matches between title and 10 leading substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a thesaurus; and (3) a count of word matches between title and 10 leading substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a thesaurus.. The second hypothesis was tested by comparing a count of short titles (with 3 or less substantive words) published in 1948, 1958, and 1968.. Results confirm that uninformative titles of chemical papers are being eliminated and that informative titles are becoming more informative since the advent of the KWIC index..

The similarities between the indexing process and the general communication process are discussed, and indexing is viewed as an order increasing (i.e., entropy decreasing) operation.. The concept of a theoretical index is developed and contrasted with real-world indexing systems..

Let me remind you of that famous place in Dickins' Pickwick Papers where we hear of a researcher who composed a copious review on Chinese Metaphysics with the aid only of the Encyclopedia Britannica, which contained absolutely no information on that subject. The technique used, we are told with a nudge of superiority, was to read for metaphysics under the letter M, and for China under the letter C, and to combine the information. I feel that we may be performing just such a miracle of creative juxtaposition when we assume that Scientific Information is just some special variety of information that contains queer words like Potassium Permanganate, pi r squared, and numbers like 2.71828.  We suppose too that Scientific Libraries are just libraries that happen to be full of scientific books, and that the best possible technical librarian would be somebody who had picked up a library qualification and combined it with the appropriate sort of technical qualification.  There is, as they used to say, no mixture of ingredients but a genuine chemical compound.  I wish to point out two simple facts:  there is more to scholarship than the mere cumulation, storage and retrieval of information, and there is about science and technology something intrinsically different from mere scholarship. \", '593': 'Human Factors in the Design of an Interactive Library System McAllister, Caryl Bell, John M. ELMS (Experimental Library Management System) is an experimental system for total library management, operating on-line with an IBM 360 through IBM 2260 and 2741 terminals.. The system is designed to handle large amounts of highly variable information which it processes on command, giving on-line computer service for all library operations.. At the same time, it must accommodate the different needs and skills of a broad range of library users, from new patrons to well-trained librarians.. Such a system presents programming problems that will be typical of large, interactive computer systems in the seventies.. This paper discusses ELMS features that facilitate user interaction, and may prove useful in similar systems:  techniques for tutoring the user (display format, one-question, one-answer displays, and KWIC indexing); adaptability for the experienced user (command chains and a standard set of four-letter mnemonic codes for higher-level control); minimization of keying (line numbers, one-character mnemonic codes used with procedures, and use of default conditions); performance of clerical tasks by exception notification; and collection of operational statistics to help improve the system..

Interactive systems, in existence for nearly 15 years, are becoming increasingly important, both for information retrieval and library support operations.. The virtues of these systems are speed, intimacy, and - if time-sharing is involved - economy.. The major problems are the cost of the large computers and files necessary for bibliographic data, the still- high cost of communications, and the generally poor design of the user- system interfaces.. The desirable features of on-line retrieval interfaces are only now being defined and tested in a systematic way, e.g., by the National Library of Medicine in its AIM-TWX nationwide experimental retrieval service.. System implementers must, in addition to engineering the right capabilities into on-line systems, also make a careful, concerted effort to engineer user acceptance.. Common pitfalls here include overselling system capabilities and failure to take into account the social context around the user terminal.. The major national problem is to avoid or limit wasteful and expensive duplication in providing nationwide search access to the hundreds of public and private data bases that will be readily available during the next few years..

In addition, a series of separate experiments was carried out to investigate the problems of controls in experimentation with IR systems.. The main conclusions:  the human factor appears to be the main variable in all components of an IR system; length of indexes affects performance considerably more than indexing languages; question analyses and search strategies to affect performance to a great extent - as much, if not  more than indexing.. Retrieval systems seem to be able to perform at present only on a general level, failing to be at the same time comprehensive and specific..

Though the idea of constructing a keyword classification for retrieval purposes automatically is not a new one, comparatively few systematic experiments have been carried out in this area; and while many suggestions have been put forward, not enough is known about the behaviour of automatic keyword classifications, and hence about the properties such classifications should have and the ways they should be used.. In previous experiments we showed that some forms of classification could give good results, and this paper describes a further series of tests designed to examine this sort of classification in more detail, with a view to establishing the optimum forms of classification and procedures for using them in different retrieval situations.. These tests demonstrate that further improvements in performance over that for unclassified keywords can be obtained, and that definite conclusions can be drawn about the correct approach to classification for collections like the test one: the best results are given when grouping is confined to strongly connected, nonfrequent keywords, when the classification is used to provide additional rather than alternative indexing terms, particularly for requests, and when matching is controlled by keyword frequency..

Compound words cause some difficulty in post-coordinate indexing systems:  if too many are fractured, or the wrong categories are selected for fracturing, noise will be produced at unacceptable levels on retrieval.. Various prior suggestions for handling compound terms are examined which include those for pre-coordinated or rotated, indexes.. The syntactic origins are also explored and it is found that many compound words hinge on a prepositional relationship between the components, and that this relationship can be applied to decision making.. Other compound words are in effect abbreviated statements from longer phrases, while some are influenced by the presence of a verb-like form.. These syntactic influences, together with some of the philosophy from earlier studies - especially that of the 'force' required to fracture a term, have been combined to produce a set of rules which have been employed at the National Rubber Producers' Research Association (NRPRA) for over two years..

With this technique the greater applicability of title-terms offsets their relative paucity.. The title-searching technique is tested using queries put to MEDLARS.. These queries were not specially solicited for the test.. Title searching is compared with the standard MEDLARS index term search and with an index term search with fixed output size.. For equal output sizes, Title searching retrieves 4 relevant references for every 5 retrieved by index term searching..

Librarians can only be of limited assistance in helping the naive user formulate an unstructured feeling in his mind into an appropriate search query that maps into the retrieval system.. Consequently, the process of query formulation by the user, interactively with the information available in te system, remains one of the principal problems in information retrieval today.. In an attempt to solve this problem by improving the interface communication between man and the computer, we have pursued the objective of displaying hierarchically structured index trees on a CRT in a decision tree format permitting the user merely to point (with a light pen) at alternatives which seem most appropriate to him.. Using his passive rather than his active vocabulary expands his interaction vocabulary by at least an order of magnitude.. Moreover, a hierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus, and may be augmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance to the user.. A hierarchical structure was chosen because it seems to replicate the structure of cognitive thought processes most closely, thus allowing the simplest, most direct transfer of the man's problem into the structure and vocabulary of the system.. \", '607': 'Improving a Field-based \"Eric-Like\" Information System Paisley, W.

Each SD consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales on which a respondent reacts, in relation to the object or concept of interest.. To interpret completed SDs, it simplifies the procedures and aids in the development of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or more independent clusters.. The primary purpose of this study was to identify those clusters (or dimensions) applied by a user of an on-line user-oriented reference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system.. Seventy-one who used or were familiar with a working on-line reference retrieval system completed a packet of 20 SDs, each consisting of the same 19 adjective scales.. The correlations among the scales were factor analyzed.. Three independent dimensions were identified.. Factor I was labeled \"evaluative-specific\" and accounted for over 23% of the total variance.. Factor II was called \"desirability\"; it accounted for over 17% of the total variance.. And, Factor III, entitled \"enormity\" accounted for over 10% of the total variance.. Another analysis showed the factor structure to be highly reliable.. Therefore, if the derived three dimensional structure underlies users\\' attitudes toward a more general class of retrieval systems, then undimensional or unstructured system evaluation of users\\' attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading.. In order to construct a working semantic differential, 10 adjective scales were identified which best represented the three dimensions..

For this reason, there are few rules and conventions for updating a thesaurus.. Consequently, most of the thesauri adopted by operating information storage and retrieval systems are not systematically updated.. In order to investigate how thesauri are actually updated, a survey was conducted.. The working hypothesis was that the communication process between authors and readers is linear in nature (\"one-way\" communication allowing no reciprocal feedback) if a thesaurus utilized in a system is not updated by both indexers and question negotiators.. Findings show that thesauri viewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cybernetic process of communication (\"both-way\" communication).. The survey indicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largely done by indexers alone.. No attempt was made to develop a theory of thesaurus construction and updating.. It was, however, argued that such a theory, if developed, should at least account for the concepts of meaning and knowledge.. Within this theoretical framework, two techniques are suggested to be considered for the systematic updating of a thesaurus..

It has been suggested that information science is still of the stage of alchemy:  if this is so then mutual exclusivity must form its philosopher's stone..

Some of these relate to everyday things like trees, beaches and man himself,  whilst others relate to more obscure phenomena like continental drift and black holes.. The act of observation is also considered as this has a considerable bearing on the problem.. Nevertheless, mutual exclusivity must form part of man's mental powers and this has found expression in the relatively exclusive series of symbols used in communication.. The dangers of exclusive thinking in relation to environmental problems are considered, and this results in a paradox which is probably unresolvable..

The philosophy of a systems approach to the design of information storage and retrieval systems is suggested in which the computer is recognized in its proper perspective as a powerful and effective alternative tool.. This philosophy is in contrast to a prevalent philosophy of the '60's in which many information systems designers touted the computer as the answer to all information storage and retrieval situations.. Important principles of information system design incorporated within the framework of the novel philosophy for the '70's are presented.. These are:  the performance of users' needs studies by the representative small group technique; the analysis of users' needs including their rank ordering by priority; the selection and adaptation for a specific application of a suitable existent information storage and retrieval system from those available; the involvement of potential users in the system design by establishing a model with which they can interact and provide feedback; and the final design of a cost-effective system..

Implementation of the Philosophy Cooper,  William S. It was argued in Part I (see JASIS, March-April 1973 p. 87) that the best way to evaluate a retrieval system is, in principle at least, to elicit subjective estimates of the system's utility to its users, quantified in terms of the numbers of utilities (e.g. dollars) they would have been willing to give up in exchange for the privilege of using the system; and a naive methodology was outlined for evaluating retrieval systems on this basis.. But the impracticality of the naive evaluation procedure as it stands raises the questions:\\tHow can one decide which practical measure is likely to yield results most closely resembling those of the naive methodology? And how can one tell whether the resemblance is close enough to make applying the measure worth while? In the present paper two kinds of solution to these problems are taken up.. The first answers the questions in terms of the reasonableness of the simplifying assumptions needed to get from the naive measure to the proposed substitute.. The second answers it by experimentation.. \", '635': 'Clustering of Scientific Journals Carpenter, Mark P.

Since the goal of the techniques is retrieval of answer-providing documents, \"answer-passages\" are retrieved.. An \"answer-passage\" is a passage which is either answer-providing or \"answer-indicative,\" i.e., it permits inferring that the document containing it is answer-providing.. In most cases answer-sentences, i.e., single-sentence answer-passages, are retrieved.. This has great advantages for screening retrieval output.. Two new automatic procedures for measuring closeness of relation between clue words in a sentence are described.. One approximates syntactic closeness by counting the number of intervening \"syntactic joints\" (roughly speaking, prepositions, conjunctions and punctuation marks) between successive clue words.. The other measure uses word proximity in a new way.. The two measures perform about equally well.. The computer uses \"enclosure\" and \"connector words\" for determining when a multi-sentence passage should be retrieved.. However, no procedure was found in this study for retrieving multi-paragraph answer-passages, which were the only answer-passages occurring in 6% of the papers.. In a test of the techniques they failed to retrieve two answer-providing documents (7% of those to be retrieved) because of one multi-paragraph answer-passage and one complete failure of clue word selection.. For the other answer-providing documents they retrieved at all recall levels with greater precision than SMART, which has produced the best previously reported recall-precision results.. The retrieval questions (mostly from real users) and documents used in this study were from the field of information science.. The results of the study are surprisingly good for retrieval in such a \"soft science,\" and it is reasonable to hope that in less \"soft\" sciences and technologies the techniques described will work even better..

Other units of size for obtaining densities, and their measurement are discussed.. There is no evidence for synchronous obsolescence in the 1955 to 1968 volumes of these journals: instead there is some statistically significant evidence of greater density of use with greater age.. Similar evidence elsewhere is cited.. The ranking order for heaviness of use is also radically altered by converting raw frequencies to densities of use..

Successful information retrieval from a mechanized file is heavily dependent on the fidelity of the representation of concepts in the particular language of the system and on the predictability of this representation.. If an index language is employed, predictability is guaranteed and the quality of the retrieval is predominantly governed by the fidelity of the representation, i.e., by the extent to which conceptual distortion of the concepts to be represented can be avoided.. The various index languages vary widely with respect to their fidelity.. Differences in their performance are correspondingly great.. The lack of fidelity in most of the present day indexing languages is due mainly to insufficient representation of the relationships among concepts.. We describe a new graphical method of storing and retrieving concept relations of various kinds.. The points of such a graph are occupied by concepts, and the connecting lines between these points represent concept relations.. In a special field of chemistry, these graphs also serve as a kind of presentation of the essentials of a document to the reader that is much more lucid than a natural language text..

A new technique, known as discrimination value analysis, ranks the text words in accordance with how much they are able to discriminate the documents of a collection from each other; that is, the value of a term depends on how much the average separation between individual documents changes when the given term is assigned for content identification.. The best words are those which achieve the greatest separation..

Thus, given an arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machine can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant documents that would not otherwise have been selected.. Finally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user..

The statistical approach to the analysis of document collections and retrieval therefrom has proceeded along two main lines, associative machine searching and automatic classification.. The former approach has been favored because of the tendency of people in the computer field to strive for new methods of dealing with the literature--methods which do not resemble those of traditional libraries.. But automatic classification study also has been thriving; some of the reasons for this are discussed.. The crucial question of the quality of automatic classification is treated at considerable length, and empirical data are introduced  to support the hypothesis that classification quality improves as more information about each document is used for input to the classification program.. Six nonjudgmental criteria are used in testing the hypothesis for 100 keyword lists (each list representing a document) for a series of computer runs in which the number of words per document is increased progressively from 12 to 36.. Four of the six criteria indicate the hypothesis holds, and two point to no effect.. Previous work of this kind has been confined to the range of one through eight words per document.. Finally, the future of automatic classification and some of the practical problems to be faced are outlined.. ', '662': 'Automatic Indexing: An Experimental Inquiry Maron, M. E.

The retrieval of documented information is one of today's most widespread technical problems, affecting almost every large professional group, corporation, and government bureau.. Because document retrieval is in part an information processing problem, much hope for a solution has vested in computers.. But large, fast, reliable ones have been around now for five year, and people have steadily realized that the over-all task of information retrieval is not one of those rote jobs for which digital computers are made to order.. Cataloging and searching are intellectual tasks, and have been thought of as rote not because they are menial and straightforward, but because they are unpalatable and unwanted.. Many people do like to use their minds, yes - but not for plowing through and discarding irrelevant material.. Many people have assumed that this would also be the case in information retrieval.. Accordingly, the rush to put computers to work in this area has led primarily to their use as searching instruments, and much activity has centered around the design and operation of searching machinery..  Boundary conditions have been assumed, such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and who knows how to express it in terms understood by the machine, and such as ideal correspondence of descriptors to the documents they describe; then attention has been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries.. The resulting theories and systems in most cases seem highly adapted to the needs of machine but not adapted to the needs of humans.. We are, after all, dealing with the elemental situation of an author talking to a reader - even if by means of a buffer storage which will grow more and more mechanical.. The basic problem is to increase the mental contact between the reader and the information store, so that the reader can proceed unerringly and swiftly to identify and receive the message he is looking for.. \", '665': 'Morphology of \"Information Flow\" Fairthorne, R.A. Such phrases as \"information flow\" may be purely metaphorical, or may refer to porterage and storage of physical documents, transmission of signals, power required for signaling, Shannon\\'s Selective Information, changes in the state of one\\'s personal knowledge, propagation of announcements concerning messages, social increase of awareness, propagation of or reaction to imperatives, and so on.  These matters are distinct and must be distinguished.  Then conditions must be stated under which one can validly speak of and measure the appropriate flow. In this paper it is shown that within the field of Notification (mention and delivery of recorded messages to users) there are twenty basic activities formed by choosing triads from the six variables, Message, Code, Channel, Source, Destination, and Designation. \"Flow\" has meaning only when two such triads have two variables in common, forming a tetrad.  Then flow or correspondence between any pair of variables is inextricable from a conjugate flow or correspondence between the other pair. Between any pair of endpoints there are six possibly distinct types of flow, according to which two of the remaining four variables are directly used to achieve the flow.

This paper describes new methods of automatically extracting documents for screening purposes, i.e. the computer selection of sentences having the greatest possible potential for conveying to the reader the substance of the document.  While previous work has focused on one component of sentence significance, namely, the presence of high-frequency content words (key words), the methods described here also treat three additional components: pragmatic words (cue words); title and heading words; and structural indicators (sentence location). The research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology. The extracting system is parameterized to control and vary the influence of the above four components.  The research methodology includes procedures for the compilation of the required dictionaries, the setting of the control parameters, and the comparative evaluation of the automatic extracts with manually produced extracts.  The results indicate that the three newly proposed components dominate the frequency component in the production of better extracts.

Many methods for the coding of chemical structures have been described in the literature.\\tSome methods code the compound only partially; typical of these are the methods using descriptor codes.  Other methods, among which the so-called ciphers are prominent, code compounds exhaustively.  All these methods require cerebral effort; that is, a chemist is needed who must have learned the rules of the code, and who must known how to dismember correctly each structure to be coded.  A disadvantage of code designations of structures is, furthermore, that they are not generally understood by chemists.  No advantages accrue to the chemist from knowing how to generate and how to interpret a chemical code.\\tCodes are needed only for the mechanical manipulation of chemical structures.

As part of the development of a computer-based chemical information system at CAS, it has been necessary to devise techniques for the registration of drawings of chemical structures.  A major purpose of the CAS registration process is to determine whether a particular structure has already been stored in the system.  The ability to make this determination makes it possible to utilize a computer to assign to every chemical structure a unique identifying label.  This identifying label, referred to as a registry number, is the thread that ties together all information associated with a particular compound throughout the developing CAS computer system.  It is because of this association, made possible by the registration process, that CAS will be able to provide multiple-file correlative searches with assurance that all information on file for a particular compound has been located.

A computer-operated storage and retrieval system for chemical structures based on the use of the IUPAC notation has been in operation at Shell Research Limited, Sittingbourne, Kent, England, since 1965, involving a file of nearly 50,000 compounds.  Use of the IUPAC cipher has proved advantageous as regards speed and cost of both input and searching.  For most searches, scanning of the information explicit in the cipher has proved adequate.

Most of these systems are also capable of handling certain fragment requests; however, the fragments which can be processed are frequently of a restricted nature.  For example, in retrieval systems which are based on linear ciphers, only those fragments which are explicit in the cipher are readily detected.  To allow a completely general specification of fragments it seems inevitable that a detailed atom-by-atom comparison is required of the query and library structures.  A technique for making such detailed comparisons is presented in this report.  This technique is novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking ad restarting required by other atom-by-atom matching procedures. Before giving the details of the proposed algorithm, some definitions are reviewed and a brief example is presented to illustrate the over-all concepts.  Then the flow diagram of the algorithm is explained in terms of additional examples.  Finally, the mechanization of the algorithm for a digital computer is discussed. This report is a condensed version of the original, which gives a generalization and comprehensive description of the algorithm, proofs of convergence and related topics, and applications other than chemical retrieval systems.

Since initial operation in 1964 as a stand-alone input, storage, and retrieval system for structural representations of organic chemical compounds, the scope of the CAS Registry System has steadily increased to include all types of chemical substances and the entire system has been integrated into CAS indexing operations.  The third refinement of this system, Registry III, which has been in operation for over a year, involves major changes in Registry recods but no change in the basic algorithmic techniques for registering chemical substances.  The previous format for listing atoms and bonds has been modified so that each ring system is now separately identified, and this ring-system identifier is used in the record for each substance that contains that ring.  These modifications support CAS nomenclature derivation and also a computer-based structure output system.

Substructure searches on CA Index nomenclature can often result in very high recall relative to topological searches, as is shown by experimental results achieved on a variety of searches.  Many data bases which contain CA Index nomenclature also contain nonsubstance data.

A basic idea suggested in this paper is that a linguistic hedge such as very, more or less, much, essentially, slightly, etc. may be viewed as an operator which acts on the fuzzy set representing the meaning of its operand.. For example, in the case of the composite term very tall man, the operator very acts on the fuzzy meaning of the term tall man.. To represent a hedge as an operator, it is convenient to define several elementary operations on fuzzy sets from which more complicated operations may be built up by combination or composition.. In this way, an approximate representation for a hedge can be expressed in terms of such operations as complementation, intersection, concentration, dilation, contrast intensification, fuzzification, accentuation, etc.. Two categories of hedges are considered.. In the case of hedges of Type I, e.g., very, much, more or less, slightly, etc., the hedge can be approximated by an operator acting on a single fuzzy set.. In the case of hedges of Type II, e.g., technically, essentially, practically, etc., the effect of the hedge is more  complicated, requiring a description of the manner in which the components of its operand are modified.. If, in addition, the characterization of a hedge requires a consideration of a metric or proximity relation in the space of its operand, then the hedge is said to be of Type IP or IIP, depending on whether it falls into category I or II.. The approach is illustrated by constructing operator representations for several relatively simple hedges such as very, more or less, much, slightly, etc.. More complicated hedges whose effect is strongly context-dependent, require the use of a fuzzy-algorithmic mode of characterization which is more qualitative in nature than the approach described in the present paper..

However, it was one of the propositions arising from Cranfield I which met with strong opposition and was quite rightly attacked. In reply to the critical review by Swanson, I had to agree that the simple hypothesis required modification.  By the following year test results coming from the experiments by Salton and from Cranfield II made further modification necessary, and the hypothesis was finally put forward to read as follows: 'Within a single system, assuming that a sequence of subsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expected decreasing precision, and the requirements are those stated in the question, there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision, if the results of a number of different searches are averaged.

Many retrieval experiments are intended to discover ways of improving performance, taking the results obtained with some particular technique as a baseline.. The fact that substantial alterations to a system often have little or no effect on particular collections is puzzling.. This may be due to the initially poor separation of relevant and non-relevant documents.. The paper presents a procedure for characterizing this separation for the collection, which can be used to show whether proposed modifications of the base system are likely to be useful..

This paper examines the implications of the findings of evaluative tests regarding the retrieval performance of natural language in various subject fields.  It suggests parallel investigations into the structure of natural language, with particular reference to terminology, as used in the different branches of basic science.  The criteria for defining the terminological consistency of a subject are formulated and a measure suggested for determining the degree of terminological consistency. The terminological and information structures of specific disciplines such as, chemistry, physics, botany, zoology, and geology; the circumstances in which terms originate; and the efforts made by the international scientific community to standardize the terminology in their respective disciplines - are examined in detail.  This investigation shows why and how an artificially created scientific language finds it impossible to keep pace with current developments and thus points to the source of natural language.

On comparing lists of titles of journals ranked by citation counting with lists of the same journals, ranked according to frequency of use (using data from a survey at the National Lending Library), it was found that the rank order correlation between the two was low..

From a discussion of the nature of truth, it is held that scientific knowledge is the only knowledge which can be regarded as true.. The method of induction from empirical data is therefore applied to the construction of a classification.. Items of knowledge are divided into uniquely definable terms, called isolates, and the relations between them, called operators.. It is shown that only four basic operators exist, expressing appurtenance, equivalence, reaction, and causation; using symbols for these operators, all subjects can be analysed in a linear form called an analet.. With the addition of the permissible permutations of such analets, formed according to simple rules, alphabetical arrangement of the first terms provides a complete, logical subject index.. Examples are given, and possible difficulties are considered.. A classification can then be constructed by selection of deductive relations, arranged in hierarchical form.. The nature of possible classifications is discussed.. It is claimed that such an inductively constructed classification is the only true representation of the structure of knowledge, and that these principles provide a simple technique for accurately and fully indexing and classifying any given set of data, with complete flexibility..

It was first observed by Bradford that, for a large collection of journal references on a given subject, most of the articles are derived from a small proportion of the total titles.  Bradford listed the journals concerned in order of decreasing productivity and, by plotting the logarithms of the cumulative totals of titles against the cumulative totals of relevant articles produced, he obtained a straight line.  (Similar results have been obtained by many later workers.  The pattern is illustrated by Table I which shows the distribution of references among journal titles obtained by the author during a study of literature usage in the petroleum industry.)  On the basis of these results Bradford then formulated a simple mathematical model to describe reference scattering.  Vickery later pointed out that this 'law of scattering' predicted not a straight line but a curve.

The foreign-language barrier facing British scientists is a function of a, the amount and value of foreign scientific literature produced; b, the linguistic ability of the people wishing to read it; and c, the availability and effectiveness of translation services.. To obtain quantitative data on these points the NLL has recently conducted a survey amongst scientists and librarians in the United Kingdom and the present paper presents the more important results.. The survey has shown that the language problem is of considerable magnitude and is common to the majority of scientists and technologists.. The languages creating the most difficulty are Russian, German, and Japanese.. It has also indicated that local translation facilities are not particularly effective and that, as far as national facilities are concerned, British scientists are largely unaware of existing services which might help them to overcome their difficulties..

One hundred and forty judges rated each of nine abstracts for relevance to several short information requirement statements.. The some judges then repeated the ratings, each adopting (assuming) one of the fourteen use orientations described to them.. It was found that the particular use orientation assumed by the judge has a marked effect on relevance judgements.. It was also found that implicit use orientations can be analysed in terms of their underlying structure and that their study offers the possibility of discovering the conditions under which one person can accurately simulate and use the implicit use orientations of another.. Relevance judgements have been used as a basis of measures designed to evaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval system..

May the age-old controversies that arose from the conventional concepts of classification not be reborn in the mechanized searching systems of the future.

This implies recognition of the relations between the classes, and the whole operation is often referred to neatly as 'locating and relating'.  Assuming that we examine only a limited set of documents (those most likely to be relevant) the operation is entirely one of classification - the recognition of particular classes and their relations.

The feasibility is examined of devising a scheme for operating a joint keyword system in a given subject area using several independently compiled thesauri.. It is suggested that if the individual keywords of each participating thesaurus represent indentifiable concepts, and these concepts are given unique code numbers, then the code numbers enable the keywords of any participating thesaurus to be converted into the appropriate keywords of any other participant.. Incompatibilities between keywords systems arise from differences in the selection and form of keywords.. Eleven types of incompatibility are identified and a method of reconciliation is proposed for each.. The types of incompatibility that can arise in a single language include those that arise between one language and another, so that a multilingual joint system presents no additional problems..

The performance of a retrieval system with a file of only a few hundred references can be measured by assessing the relevance of each reference to each of a number of queries.. A suitable measure of retrieval performance is then the Recall ratio - the fraction of the relevant references that are retrieved by the system.. When the file is large this method of measuring performance is not practicable, and Recall cannot be measured although it can be estimated.. A number of estimation procedures are examined and found unsatisfactory.. Another measure of retrieval performance is the Extension ratio which is approximately the ratio of the quantity of known relevant references before and after putting a query to the retrieval system..

Altogether, thirty-nine questions that users had previously asked of the Science Information Exchange (SIE) of the Smithsonian Institution, and that were in the four subjects areas, were employed by SIE staff scientists, and twelve of these were independently used by staff members of the Biological Science Communication Project (BSCP) of the George Washington University..

This divides the file into retrieved and not-retrieved references.. An alternative is to assign each reference score calculated from its index terms and to retrieve the N highest scoring references in the file.. This scoring technique has several advantages in theory, and it performed slightly better in a retrieval test with N equal to the number of references retrieved by the corresponding Boolean search.. In the test a minimum value of N = 10 was used, and when less then this number of references matched the Boolean search requirement, the Scoring technique successfully widened the score of the search and retrieved twice as many relevant references as the Boolean searches..

It outlines a simple survey method whereby readers record the non-availability of books which they are looking for.. The survey has already been installed at four university libraries, but the results from only one library are considered here.. These results show how a librarian can find out the degree of non-availability or failure in any particular area of the library, the causes of failure, and even the particular items which are in heavy demand and not available.. They also provide information on the degree of co-operation by the readers, the number of titles failing once, twice, three times etc., the overlap of demand for popular books by different groups of borrowers, the waiting time for books that failed, the pattern of demand for particular books over a period of time, the relationship between failure and recall, the correlation of failure from one term to the next, and the relative use of books inside and outside the library.. From the results it was possible to recommend certain changes in library procedure which should have reduced failure, and to compare the titles of books failing in the Main Library with the holdings of a departmental library..

The exhaustivity of document descriptions and the specificity of index terms are usually regarded as independent.. It is suggested that specificity should be interpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than of term meaning.. The effect on retrieval of variations in term specificity are examined, experiments with three test collections showing in particular that frequently-occurring terms are required for good overall performance.. It is argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms.. Results for the test collections show that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure..

The choice of the suitable data base for providing an information service is governed by factors of coverage, performance, and cost.. The cost of the data base to subscribers is a known quantity, and the coverage is decided by the data base producers..

The performance was measured in terms of the relative currency of the four data-bases, on the retrieval efficiency of profiles searched against them.. Fifty questions from industrial and government research organizations were used in the experiment.. Search profiles corresponding to these questions were constructed for searching against each database, output was assessed for relevance by users, and profile performance figures (precision and recall ratios) were calculated for each profile..

This paper continues the reporting of the Unit's work on a method of investigating how often readers fail to find what they are looking for on the shelves, why they fail, and what particular books they fail to find.. The method used is a slight modification of the earlier one - readers were asked to record on a slip provided the details of the book or periodical they were looking for, or subject area they were looking in, their academic status, and the date, and then to place the slip in an adjoining box.. Fron analysis of these 'failure' slips it was possible to determine the cause of the reader's failure, the individual book the reader was looking for, and the pattern of failure for different groups of volumes.. A new development was surveys of samples of readers, carried out during the fortnight of peak demand.. Answers to these surveys provided information on the effect or failure on a reader's work, what action he took after failing, whether he found adequate substitutes, how many books he found by browsing, and what proportion of the books he consulted he borrowed.. Some of these answers could be checked by a direct count of the books used in, and borrowed from, the library.. The investigations were carried out in three University libraries, each with its own characteristic library structure and teaching patterns..

A simplistic statement, perhaps, but it is rare that a library's objectives are defined in any terms other than the broadest - for example, 'to meet the needs of its users'.  In fact, the definition of objectives in any service organization is likely to be an iterative process, but the explicit commitment to users' needs (however mystical this concept may be) requires the librarian to examine users' behaviour as a first step to determining policy.

SDI from 'Nuclear Science Abstracts' Olive, G. Terry, J. E. Datta, S. A Selective dissemination of Information service based on computer scanning of Nuclear Science Abstracts tapes has operated at Harwell since October 1968.. Users' interest profiles are constructed using Euratom index terms and NSA subject categories assigned to each item in NSA.. The performance of the mechanized SDI service has been compared with that of the pre-existing current awareness service which is based on visual scanning of journals and reports by information staff.. The visual service was found to be providing an important service of good currency and high precision, about 85%, to a limited number of users.. the mechanized service is less selective and of lower precision, approximately 50%, but can be expanded more readily.. In order to compare the effectiveness of Euratom index terms and words on titles for computer SDI matching, an experiment was set up in which sixty users of the mechanized service assessed NSA document notifications which were generated by matching either index terms and subject categories, or words in titles and subject categories, without being aware of the method of matching.. Over 10,000 document assessments, fron six issues of NSA were returned.. The average precision was 45.6% for index terms and 47.3% for title words.. Index terms retrieved more documents, in the ratio 1.13:1, but both systems missed many relevant documents retrieved by the other.. Index terms retrieved only 58% of the relevant documents selected by titles.. The converse ratio was 51%.. No significant effects of document types or subject on the relative effectiveness of two matching systems were found, but when the results were analyzed by title length it appeared that for titles longer than about 100 characters title words gave recall equal to that of index terms, though with a lower precision..

As a result a rapid and large increase has taken place in the research activity in this field and biophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study.. The consequent enormous growth of literature  in the field has created great difficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject.. To cope with this unprecedented growth of literature, a ranking list of periodicals in this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the Annual review of biochemistry for 1968, 1969, and 1970.. This list is expected to reflect the impact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately than the list prepared by Henkle in 1938.. The present list brings out the predominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific effort today, and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemical methodologies.. A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to size of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has been developed and applied in this study.. The analysis yields three parameters which should be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal in relation to the number of paper published, compactness of the information content, and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness of presentation.. The results of the present study have been discussed in relation to Bradford's Law of Scattering and an extension of the Law has been suggested, namely, that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in a scientific disciplines, articles of interest to that discipline appear in increasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field..

From the data obtained, unit costs have been derived for most operations, and the factors contributing to variations in the figures are discussed.. Analysis of the data has shown that costs are affected more significantly by factors such as system management, salary variations, and productivity of staff, than by technical factors such as depth of indexing, data preparation methods, or computer programming..

PRECIS, or the PREserved Context Indexing System, differs in some respects from traditional alphabetical indexes and lists of subject headings. Like the system developed by Coates for the British Technology Index, PRECIS consists essentially of a set of working procedures, not a prescribed list of terms or phrases.  The system is firmly based upon the concept of an open-ended vocabulary, which means that terms can be admitted into the index at any time, as soon as they have been encountered in literature. Once a term has been admitted, its relationships with other terms are handled in two different ways, distinguished as the syntactical and the semantic sides of the system.

While Fairthorne may not have been the first person to recognize it, certainly, for this author, Fairthorne was the first to make explicit the fundamental problems of information retrieval systems, namely the clash between OBNA and ABNO (Only-But-Not-All and All-But-Not-Only). Although it was not until 1958 that the terms occur in Fairthorne's writings, the concept had been discussed in many meetings of the AGARD Documentation Panel and elsewhere.  Originally it was considered that to meet these two requirements, it might be necessary to have two separate systems, and the test of the UNITERM system in 1954 was based on the hypothesis that a 'Marshalling' system (e.g. U.D.C.) was fundamentally different from a 'Retrieval' system (e.g. UNITERM).  While the idea persisted in this form for some time, it gradually evolved into the inverse relationship of recall and precision, which is to say that while it is possible to obtain, of the relevant documents, All-But-Not-Only, or alternatively to obtain Only-But- Not-All, it is not possible to obtain All and Only. \", '827': 'The Evaluation of Information Retrieval Systems Farradane, J.

In spite of large increases in journal prices (which have risen much faster, in terms of cost per page, than the Retail Price Index), university libraries have, since the NLLST was established, devoted an increasingly high proportion of their budgets to journals, though recent financial pressures are now forcing cancellation.. An extensive survey of demand for journals at BLLD shows a heavy concentration on a relatively small number of titles, most of them well established journals, widely held by libraries and with large circulations..

Machine retrieval is also hampered by the fact that any individual concept is notated differently, depending on where in the scheme it appears.. The approach now considered is from an organized universe of concepts, every concept being set down only once in an appropriate vocabulary, where it acquires the notation which identifies it wherever it is used.. It has been found that all the concepts present in any compound subject can be handled as though they belong to one of two basic concept types, using either Entitles or Attributes.. In classing, these concepts are identified, and notation is selected from appropriate schedules.. Subjects are then built according to formal rules, the final class number incorporating operators which convey the fundamental relationships between concepts..

A simple, standard method of recording and costing is urged, so that librarians may readily identify procedures requiring improvement.. Development of the present costing method is traced from its original state as a simple management information system based on exception reporting (i.e. reporting the exceptions which occur in any particular survey), through a pilot study in a large university library, to its full installation in two further university libraries.. The method of analyzing the raw data is described, and examples of the tables are given, together with brief background information on the libraries concerned.. After a note on the limitations of the present costing method and of unit costs in general, unit times and costs are given for numerous operations in both the libraries surveyed, covering both reader and technical services.. There is agreement between results of several American studies and those of the present investigation.. For further comparison, the information on times and salaries has been used in conjunction with a standard civil service costing procedure..

The principal service offered was a manual current awareness service, based mainly on the scanning of primary and abstracting journals. The service was evaluated by feedback slips returned by clients for each reference notified, and by a questionnaire at the end of the experiment. The relevance performance was good, and few references had been seen before; some precision could have been sacrificed to ensure comprehensive recall.  The whole service was rated highly by nearly all users and considered to be a high priority among the various possible claims on university resources.

The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, which function most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or those which are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experiment and uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by nonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using the Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the usual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the statistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the \"optimal\" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few documents are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more effective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents are wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for the quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never improves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A corollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same average breadth where one indexing consists of semantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the other consists of merely \"reasonable\" index terms.. The result suggest that title-term indexing is qualifiedly superior.. ', '895': \"Design Equations for Retrieval System Based on the Swets Model Heine, M. H.

Our analyses have necessarily been limited by the specific aims of the project, but we have been constantly aware that there are many other possible analyses of the same material.  For this reason we have endeavoured to include in the Appendix as much of this \"raw\" data as possible and to provide in the text itself, when presenting our own analyses, as much detail as possible of the methodology and other background information necessary for any full evaluation. ', '901': 'Language and Information Selected Essays on their Theory and Application Barhillel, Y. At one time or another many authors must have faced the dilemma of whether to gather their articles published on a certain topic and republish them as a collection of essays or whether to rework them into an entirely new book.  I decided in favor of the first course with regard to the articles I had written during the last fifteen years on language and information, in particular on the more technical and applied aspects, leaving for some future occasion my papers on the philosophy of language. ', '902': 'Language and Mind Chomsky, N. The three chapters of this book are somewhat elaborated versions of three lectures, the Beckman lectures, that I delivered at the University of California, at Berkeley, in January 1967.  The first is an attempt to evaluate past contributions to the study of mind that have been been based on research and speculation regarding the nature of language.  The second is devoted to contemporary developments in linguistics that have a bearing on the study of the mind.  The third is a highly speculative discussion of directions that the study of language and mind might take in coming years. The three lectures, then, are concerned with the past, the present, and the future. ', '903': 'Development of the County Law Library Jurkins, J. Do you know that there are 3,071 counties and parishes and 59 county equivalents in the United States, making a total of 3,130? Do you know that only 39 states have statutory provisions for county law libraries? Do you know that seven states have no listing for county law libraries in the American Association of Law Libraries 1968 Directory of Law Libraries? Do you know that Los Angeles County, California, not only has the largest county law library collection in the United States, but it also has seven branch law libraries? These four questions readily point out the simple fact that the growth and development of county law libraries in the United States has been uneven, without pattern or standards, not only on a State-to-State basis, but on a county- to-county basis within a particular state.   A survey of the 39 state statutes relating to county law libraries reveals that there are no two states that have exactly the same method for the establishment, administration, financial support, or maintenance of a county law library. ', '904': 'No Special Rules for Entry of Serials Carpenter, Michael One of the objectives of a library catalog is to enable one to determine what books or publications by an author are in the library.. Establishment of special rules of entry for serial publications which preclude attribution of authorship defeats this objective.. The present rule 6 of the Anglo_American Cataloging Rules are the Paris Principles are criticized in this regard.. In the course of this criticism, it is shown that the presence of a generic title, the presence of the name of a corporate body within the serial publication are not valid criteria for determining authorship of a serial publication.. Furthermore, using the form of publication produces unpredictable entries for serials.. Therefore, it is proposed that special rules for entry of serials be abolished, that a serial be treated like any other work of corporate or personal authorship, including compilations and works produced under editorial direction.. This will have the added benefit of allowing consistent treatment of instances of corporate and personal authorship.. ', '905': 'Periodicals for the Small Bio-Medical and Clinical Library Hunt, J.W. Since the advent of periodical literature in the seventeenth century well over ten thousand journals have been published in the field of bio-medicine.  Many of these have ceased publication; others are only of local interest.  Still, approximately two thousand desirable periodicals in this field are being currently released.  As research and discovery are recorded in the journal literature, the greatest asset of a scientific library is its subscription list and periodical holdings.  It therefore becomes a major responsibility of such libraries to make this wealth of experimental data available to their readers.  When funds are limited, the selection of a periodical collection that will best serve the most urgent needs of the reader becomes of paramount importance.  A plan of highly selective purchasing must be adopted to prevent the improper use of funds.  Actual needs of the library must be at hand to carry out such a plan.

The chapters consist of a series of introductory explorations into several related fields. Some of these areas are usually included in curricula for library studies programmes, under a title such as \"The library and the community\" or \"The social background to libraries.\" ', '907': 'Libraries of the Future Licklider, J.C.R. This report of research on concepts and problems of \"Libraries of the Future\" records the result of a two-year inquiry into the applicability of some of the newer techniques for handling information to what goes at present by the name of library work - i.e, the operations connected with assembling information in recorded form and of organizing and making it available for use.

This book, Libraries at Large, is itself one tangible outcome of Advisory Commission activity, representing the combined efforts of Duke University, the R.R. Bowker Company, members of the Commission and its several study groups, and many other diverse individuals within and without the library world.  The resultant theme is the same one that characterized the work of our Commission from the beginning - namely, a concern that every individual in our society be provided with library and informational services adequate to his current and emerging needs.  Confronting this goal requires a recognition of inevitable change, and we have questioned status quo, recognizing at the same time the differing pace and character requisite for the implementation of designs in the adaptability to change.  The national interest demands simultaneous sympathy with people in pockets of illiteracy and people in the vanguards of intellectual achievement. ', '909': 'Libraries and Librarianship in the West: A Brief History Jackson, S.L. This book was written in an attempt to fill a gap.  If one ignored the major historical resources in other languages (which few United States students read), notably the Handbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaft, edited by Fritz Milkau and others (2d ed., Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1952-1957; Registerband, 1965), it was plain that the goodly company of works available did not meet all fundamental needs.  The most nearly comprehensive treatment was Elmer C. Johnson\\'s A History of Libraries in the Western World (Scarecrow, 1965), which remains in its second edition (Scarecrow, 1970) solid and attractive reading but continues as announced to cover only libraries.  Its attention to librarianship is very limited; numerous important theorists are not even mentioned.  Furthermore, the predominant organization by type of library hampers the analysis of crosscurrents between libraries and life and thought, particularly the development of the image of the library and librarian.  The aim here has been to tie it all together. In the present offering, \"the West\" is used conventionally: European civilization, with its Near Eastern ancestors and its Western Hemisphere progeny.  The limitation is practical.  To try to \"cover\" even the West may prove to be too much for one person; to go beyond would be rash.  Yet an understanding of those lands \"beyond\" would be most valuable to us all. Let us hope that someone will try to provide it. ', '910': 'Libraries and Neighborhood Information Centers Kromes, C.L. It has been suggested by various librarians concerned with inner-city service that the library serve as an informational and interpersonal link between community residents and social agencies.  The major question is whether it is necessary to add another agency to the already overburdened social service bureaucracy.  The rationale for envisioning the library in this role is twofold:  (1) the library has achieved a reputation for impartiality because it provides information on all sides of an issue and is not committed to any particular action program, community service or clientele; and (2) librarians are specifically trained to locate, organize, update and disseminate information. ', '911': 'Libraries and the Organization of Knowledge Shera, J.H. From time to time, in the course of its historical development, a professional activity enters a new stage.  This usually takes place as the culmination of a series of modifications to the practice of the art, arising out of changes in the social situation in which the profession operates. Skilled workers, sensitive to changing needs, alter or refine their practice so that it develops in tune with the progress of society itself.  Descriptive accounts of new or improved methods appear in the literature; and, from time to time, a leading thinker makes a new synthesis by combining these explanations into a system, or theory, which gives a rational account of what is going on, and so prepares the way forward. This is what Dean Jesse H. Shera has set out to do in this collection of his essays and addresses. ', '912': \"Libraries in Political Science Dosa, M.L. This study undertakes to document the process and the thinking that led Leyh to his controversial professional-political activities and his widely criticized writings in his later years.  Every effort has been made to present the documentary material and to analyze Leyh's reactions to political and psychological pressures without favoring any particular position.  Neither a justification nor a critique of Leyh's actions is intended. \", '913': 'On the construction and care of white elephants Grose, M.W. Line M.B. Although catalogue codes and standards have received much attention, there has been very little fundamental questioning of cataloguing principles and practice.  Basic questions in need of investigation include: whether individual libraries need catalogues of their own stock; how far printed  bibliographies could serve as a substitute; the functions catalogues are serving at present, and the actual demands placed on them; the nature of users and non-users, and the possible conflicts between the catalogue needs of librarians and non-librarians; the psychological factors of approachability and usability; whether standardization should over-rule local needs; whether catalogues should be designed for use by readers at all; the functions of printed national catalogues; the implications of increased co-operation and of the changing functions of libraries; what a catalogue entry should contain and how it should be arranged; and the possible administrative uses of catalogue data. Mechanization has made these questions of great urgency. ', '914': 'Library and information science abstracts A new service for librarians and documentalists Edwards, T.

The goal of this book, Library Automation: Experience, Methodology, and Technology of the Library as an Information System, is to provide a perspective of the library functions that have been or might be mechanized or automated, an outline of the methodology of the systems approach, an overview of the technology available to the library, and a projection of the prospects for library automation. There is a concern in every library for the proper handling and control of a veritable flood of material and for the prompt and convenient fulfillment of service demands.  That concern is matched by excitement about the possibilities for effective use of the computers and communications network in many library functions.  Knowledge, the library's stock-in-trade, is being generated at an unprecedented rate and sought after with unprecedented intensity.  Technology, the driving force behind the library's problems and one hope for future solution, is being advanced to unprecedented levels. \", '917': 'Library Automation Systems Salmon, S.R. This book is intended as a reasonably comprehensive discussion of library automation systems for the librarian without previous knowledge or experience in the field, and for the intelligent layman. Library automation systems, in the context of this work, are combinations of electronic data processing machines and appropriate programs and operating procedures, organized to work together in carrying out, with a minimum of human intervention, some well-defined library process.  It is a field that many thoughtful observers feel has reached a certain maturity, and so deserves to have its portrait made. ', '918': \"Library of Congress Goodrum, C.A. The book was built on interviews with the Library's middle managers, on discussions with working specialists in the various divisions, on conversations with and questionnaires sent to out-of-Library users, and from my own observations through almost twenty-five years in the Library's Congressional Research Service.  After the text was completed, it was read by appropriate people in each department for factual content and ultimately by the staff in the Librarian's Office for their comment.  At no point was there pressure to change text or conclusions - although there were plenty of good-natured suggestions on details, and nearly everyone urged a fuller description of his own particular specialty! \", '919': 'ISBD(S) and Title Main Entry for Serials Spalding, C. S. The International Meeting of Cataloguing Experts, convened in Copenhagen in 1969 under the auspices of the IFLA Committee on Uniform Cataloguing Rules (later Committee on Cataloguing), set in motion the first major development in continuation of the success achieved by the Paris International Conference on Cataloguing Principles (1961) in the matter of the principles and general rules for entry and heading.  Taking under consideration the study of \"Bibliographical Data in National Bibliography Entries\" prepared by Michael Gorman, the experts of the Copenhagen meeting set up a working group, with Jack Wells as chairman, charged with drafting an international standard bibliographic description for monographic publications.  There was common agreement that the objective was the development of specifications for the necessary data elements, their order of presentation, and the punctuation to delimit them.  These specifications should be designed to satisfy the needs of national bibliographies, and, with whatever judicious trimming might be desirable, the needs of the libraries of the entire world.  It was further agreed that these bibliographic descriptions were to be made quite independently of the heading under which they might appear in listings.  The working group succeeded in its task and brought forth its provisional ISBD(M) in 1971; the first standard edition was published earlier this year.  The success of this standard is manifested by the continuing increase in the number of countries that have adopted it. ', '920': 'Main Entry for Serials Howard, J.H. The nature of serials is such that, in both the ALA Cataloging Rules for Author and Titles Entries and the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (AACR),there are special rules for choice of entry for serials that differ from the rules for monographs.  While the Statement of Principles Adopted at the International Conference on Cataloging Principles (Paris Principles) leaves much room for interpretation and controversy regarding serials, it also provides for special rules for choice of entry.

The final report from the Association of Research Libraries' ad hoc Committee on Machine-Based Serials, written in January of this year, showed that of the 86 libraries which participated in the  committee's survey of efforts in the area of machine-readable serials files, 64 had files containing a total of 1,723,568 titles.  Twenty-two libraries reported having no files and one library indicated that it was in the process of converting its file.  The cost of converting these files is approximately $1,500,000, not to mention the utilization of an incredible amount of duplicate conversion effort. \", '922': 'Library Catalogs:  their preservation and maintenance by photographic and automated techniques; a study Henderson, J.W. The major conclusions and recommendations of the study which follows are: That the catalogs of The Research Libraries of the New York Public Library be divided chronologically at the earliest possible date; That the present (or retrospective) Public Catalog be reproduced photographically in book form; That the future (or prospective) catalogs be produced in a combination of card and book form from a store of machine-readable data; That a Central Serial Record be created to contain acquisition information, cataloging and holdings data, and bindery records for all serial publications in The Research Libraries.

With these changes have come alternations in the role of institutions of higher education.  During the Centennial Year we shall try to measure the need and nature of further change and to evolve ideas that may influence its direction.  In keeping with this idea, the Graduate School of Library Science of the University of Illinois felt that this indeed was a time propitious for holding an International Conference on Education for Librarianship. The profession as a whole and library education in particular are still quite young, but in less than one hundred years we have seen revolutionary changes.  Demands have been made on the world\\'s libraries, and in turn on the schools\\' training personnel for these libraries, almost too rapidly for them to satisfy.  It seemed logical for library education, therefore, \"to measure the need and nature of future change and to evolve ideas that may influence its direction.\" ', '924': 'Library Education and Training Bonn, G.S. The Conference on Library Education and Training in Developing Countries was arranged in order (1) to examine more closely the present facilities, curricula, and programs for training library workers in the developing countries of the world closest to Hawaii, those in East and South Asia; (2) to determine their short- and long-range needs for trained library workers; and (3) to determine their needs for additional library education and training facilities and for revised curricula.  In the light of this information the Conference proposed to evaluate the assistance given in recent years by American advisors and temporary library school faculty in these countries, and then to ascertain the roles that both local library schools and their counterparts in the United States can play in serving the needs for trained library workers in these and other developing countries. ', '925': 'Library Effectiveness Morse, P.M. This book is an experiment - in several respects.  The pressures of rising publication, together with the dazzling potentialities of the electronic computer, are forcing librarians to think more quantitatively about their libraries than most of them ever have before and, simultaneously, have aroused the interest of the computer expert and the systems analyst in information storage and retrieval systems, of which the library is still the most successful exemplar. ', '926': 'The Lending of Books to One Another by Libraries Green, S.S. It would add greatly to the usefulness of our reference libraries if an agreement should be made to lend books to each other for short periods of time. It happens not unfrequently that some book is called for by a reader, or that in looking up the answer to a question a librarian has occasion to use a book which he finds in the catalogue of another library, but which does not belong to his own collection. The book, very likely, is one that can be replaced if lost.  But it would take time to get it through ordinary channels; it might be necessary to send abroad for a copy or to wait to pick up one, if the book is scarce.  In such a case it would be a great convenience to be able to borrow a book for a few days. ', '927': 'Personal Relations Between Librarians and Readers Green, S.S. When scholars and persons of high social position come to a library, they have confidence enough, in regard to the cordiality of their reception, to make known their wishes without timidity or reserve. Modest men in the humbler walks of life, and well-trained boys and girls, need encouragement before they become ready to say freely what they want. A hearty reception by a sympathizing friend, and the recognition of some one at hand who will listen to inquiries, even although he may consider them unimportant,  make it easy for such persons to ask questions, and put them at once on a  home footing. ', '928': 'The Divided Catalog Elrod, J.M. As early as 1905 the divided catalog was being presented as a preferable alternative to the dictionary catalog. Writing in 1958 Dorothy Grosser found that the steady stream of papers on the subject began in 1938.  She reported 21 articles based on actual experience with the divided catalog.  A quick check of her list discloses that all divided catalogs are not represented by articles. She recorded nine opponents of the divided  catalog and six better known members of the profession reserving judgement.  Lyle in his new edition of The Administration of the College Library considers it \"safer,\" rather than \"wiser\" as in his earlier edition, to await further evidence. Faced at Central Methodist College Library with a dictionary catalog which had outgrown its cabinets and which was to be expanded, a survey of catalog user opinion was undertaken to determine if some division of the catalog should be considered. Some revision of the filing would be needed anyway because of inconsistencies which had crept in, largely involving the inter-filing of subject and title entries.  The following questions were asked of all users of the catalog during hours selected at random over several weeks: 1. Are you looking for a particular book or for books on a particular subject? Were you looking under author, title, or subject? 2. What is your greatest difficulty in using the catalog? 3. How would you feel about having the subject cards in a separate file? One hundred persons, approximately one tenth of the campus population, were questioned; 93 per cent felt that they would prefer having subject cards in a separate catalog, 5 per  cent were opposed, and 2 per cent undecided. It must be admitted that the prejudice of the person asking may have influenced the way in which the question was answered - a similar survey made in 1954 by the University of Toronto showed general support for the dictionary catalog. ', '929': 'The Trading Stamp Mentality Stokes, R. A number of trips to the United States, to teach in library schools, have inculcated in me a variety of views about the present state of American library education.  They are personal opinions - no more - but they come from one who has seen much that he admires and who believes wholeheartedly that the American spirit includes  a firm resolution to change whatever is inefficient or corrupt.  Otherwise, 1776 would have no meaning.  The opinions do not stem directly from my experience in the five accredited schools in which I have taught, but are strongly rooted in my general observation of library education practice and my discussions with members of the library profession. ', '930': \"Top Priority for Cataloging-In-Source Wheeler, J.L. After a century of public library service and progress, public libraries attract less than a third, perhaps only a quarter of the adult population, either to read and borrow books, or to look up information. But nearly 60 per cent of the population is over 21. Currently a few large city libraries show slight decreases in  annual circulation, the major measure of their usefulness.  Yet, nationally, circulation and the informational use of public libraries have in general steadily increased, especially in the last decade.  Possibly  because the number of public, college, university, and special libraries doubled, from 13,676 reported in 1960, to 27,746 in 1968 (Publishers' Weekly, January 20, 1969).  And there are more than that many school libraries. \", '931': 'Backlog to Frontlog Scilken, M.H. A scheme for circulating nonfiction books without the help of the Library of Congress. ', '932': 'The Urban Library Dilemma Gaines, E.J. The American urban public library is in something of a dilemma. Relatively secure in the affections of the populace, the library is nevertheless frequently threatened by loss of income. The threats are cyclical and are associated with the local tax picture, which at the present time is notably obscure.  The abortive attempts earlier this year to reduce appropriations for the libraries in Newark and New York received widespread attention both because the libraries are quite visible nationally and because the proposed cuts were preposterously unmistakable.  In the eye of the politician who must find that tiny bit of safe water between the shoals of economy and those of service, the library appears to be expendable ballast to be dumped in heavy weather.  In 12 years in two city libraries, I have seen almost every budget year produce a critical fight to prevent disaster from overtaking the library.  I think the experience is not uncommon.  Only the most extraordinary efforts keep most urban libraries from going under. Libraries seldom thrive; they survive. Periods of calm and prosperity are rare for urban public libraries in the richest nation in the world during this era of extraordinary national economic success. The paradox invites some critical self-analysis. ', '933': 'The Library Press Moon, E. The deadliest disease afflicting the library press is proliferation.  The kindest and most conservative estimate I am able to bring myself to make is that there are at least three times as many library periodicals in this country as we can afford or are necessary. Perhaps the most constructive single thing that could be accomplished would be to persuade at least one in three publishers of a library periodical to cease publication. One might reasonably expect that librarians, who have done so much public wailing about the publication explosion, would be among the chief advocates and practitioners of birth control in the world of print.  Instead we find them cavorting as uninhibitedly in the king-size bed of printed procreation as do the denizens of the Sodom and Gomorrah of science and technology. Just about every library of any consequence (and some of little consequence) and, almost without exception, every group or organization within the loose boundaries of our  profession, decides, virtually at the moment of its birth, that it cannot survive without a publication of its own - a newsletter, a journal, some regular calling card to announce its presence to the world at large. ', '934': 'Library Education and the Public Library Garrison, G. A major and largely justifiable criticism of library education has always been that it is too closely tied to present practices and that it trains for current service instead of educating for growth and change.  Unfortunately, the picture many faculty members have of what today\\'s requirements for public library service are tends to be obsolete.  Graduates are thus doubly handicapped.  Not only do we fail to educate, we fail even to provide realistic training.  At worst, we perpetuate the past and train people for tasks that are no longer central to the concerns of public libraries.   Library education, like the public library itself, will have to accelerate the pace of change or risk the fate of oblivion.  Institutions that can move with the times and maintain a position of relevance to contemporary affairs will survive.  Others will wither away, disappear, or be replaced by more responsive agencies.  There is no shortage of prophets of doom for both the public library and for graduate library education, but there are plenty of signs of life yet in both. An article in the June 13, 1968 issue of The Reporter called \"Dust Gathers on the Public Library\" summed up nicely the apparent slow decline and loss of purpose of a once-revered institution (however, The Reporter is dead - while the public library lives on).

A battle is currently being waged at the University of Maryland School of Library and Information Services; its outcome will influence the future of the library profession.  Because of the significance of this controversy, this situation at Maryland is here brought to the attention of the profession at large.   Last fall, a group, with funding from the Office of Education, brought into being an educational program which is addressing the profession's most critical problems, those central to its survival as a viable social institution:  The library profession's need to define and fulfill an important service function in the public arena; its failure to make itself relevant to other than middle-class interests in the culture; and its inavailability to contribute to the alleviation of the severe social, economic, and other inequalities which exist in the culture and which continue to deprive black Americans particularly of even minimal life opportunities. \", '936': 'Along the Academic Way Mason, E.

', '938': \"Library Cost Analysis:  A Recipe Kountz, J. Unforgivably, time has passed since the days when the library's patron was the local monarch and cost was no deterrent.  Time's passage has replaced the monarch with taxpayers or stockholders, and, concurrently, sensitivity to cost has attained stellar importance.   The causes for being unaware of costs may stem from a variety of reasons, but they cannot, in all fairness to the profession, belie an inability to perform the simple arithmetic of cost accounting. What is suspected is a lack of the few simple ground rules and the logical operations that bind them together, in short - a recipe for cost accounting and analysis. In the following is outlined one such set of ground rules and their related procedural requirements, which have evolved and been applied with success over the past few years.  It is stressed that since this set represents the findings of one library, it may not fully satisfy the specific requirements of your own shop. Therefore, feel free to adopt the ground rules to your immediate requirements.  With regard to discipline, it is pretty much summed up in the six steps and five resource requirements which follow.  In addition to identifying steps, requirements, and the mysterious ways of cost analysis, these ingredients are blended together in a manner which will be meaningful for your internal operations and may be significant for your library's future. \", '939': 'The Paradoxes of Library Cooperation Dougherty, R.M. The need for libraries to cooperate has long been recognized, as countless articles written within the past decade will attest.  Moreover, the necessity to combine forces has never been as apparent as it is today.  Because the cost of self-sufficiency has become undeniably prohibitive, libraries can no longer afford to act as free agents.  Voluntary library cooperation is no natural manifestation of social interaction.  Rhetoric alone is a impotent agent of change.  In truth, cooperative programs succeed only as long as each participant perceives the arrangement as beneficial to his institution.

A proper understanding of the International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD), a standard promulgated by the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA), requires some knowledge of how it came into existence, what reasoning prompted its development, ad what useful results can be expected from its adoption.

Users of LC catalog cards will require retraining: all reference librarians will experience an immediate and continuing demand for explanation of the new catalog cards to users; those large public and research libraries with computer-based systems will require costly modifications of computer programs. Yet the ISBD (International Standard Bibliographic Description) is destined to be implemented by the Library of Congress with the sanction of ALA but without even being considered by the recognized standards associations (ISO, ANSI), to say nothing of the other professional and information industry organizations.

The battle lines are being drawn for a great debate over the emotionally and politically charged issue of how library and information services are to be funded in the coming decades. Most librarians will be on the side of \"conservatism\" and \"democracy,\" favoring the continuation of traditional modes of tax-supported public library service with information freely available to all as a matter of right.  Information industry people, publishers, government officials, engineers, and even, perhaps, authors will be on the side of \"progress\" and \"profits,\" advocating a new concept of for-profit or pay libraries, user charges, and information as a salable commodity. ', '943': 'Austerity, Technology, and Resource Sharing: Research Libraries Face the Future De Gennaro, R. During the last two decades academic libraries, in parallel with their parent institutions, experienced the greatest period of growth and affluence that they have ever known.  The watchword was \"more\" - more money, more books and journals, more staff, more space, and more technology.  Many new research libraries were created, and those that already existed experienced unprecedented growth.  Although libraries got more of everything during those years, they still could not keep pace with the growth of new fields of research, new doctoral programs, and the increasing production of books and journals.  Two decades of affluence not only failed to help solve the many problems that were brought on by exponential growth - they exacerbated them. ', '944': 'The View from the Tower of Babel Gore, D. A funny thing happened on the way to the biggest building boom in library history.  Book collections grew faster than the new space to hold them, so when the boom was over the aggregate space problem of academic libraries was a little worse than it was at the beginning. During the roughly eight-year span of the rise and fall of the boom, some 570 new or expanded library buildings sprang up on the campuses of four-year and graduate institutions around the nation.

Although the use of games in professional education has become widespread only during the last decade, the method has been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years. Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in military training when the \"real thing\" was either unavailable or too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games have become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved. Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education, from primary school classes to courses for experienced men and women.

The problem investigated by the research was the development of standards for reading materials that would support the adult new reader in the exercise of his new-found skill and build the habit of regular use of the printed word.  Bridging the gap between minimal literacy skills and the reading habit was proposed as essential to the purposes of the library program in helping the reader improve has basic education skills, increase his employability, and develop his potential as a citizen and gain personal satisfaction in his many adult roles.  The nature of library materials best designed for this end required study in depth.  The findings and conclusions derived from the research project provide basic information about the adult new reader and his reading, criteria for analysis of reading materials, and a bibliography of materials.

The combination of computers and communications technology is a development whose time has come for libraries in the U.S. And despite missteps and false starts inevitable in adapting the new technology for its use, libraries are now rapidly expanding telecommunications networks to serve their need to disseminate ever-expanding amounts of information in more effective ways. It makes a good deal of sense when one considers that the library's function is to parcel out information, and that information can be forwarded electronically as easily as it can be mailed. In fact, the logic of library networks is such that everyone is hopping on the bandwagon -- consultants, systems analysts, state agencies and a growing list of manufacturers that includes Xerox and International Business Machines.  Their initial efforts are concentrated on what are basically bookkeeping tasks -- in particular, the cataloging of new acquisitions.  The Ohio college Library Center, for example, provides its customers with entries for their card catalog files; and because OCLC is the first and most extensive of the networks, its approach is being closely copied by the others. \", '948': 'Library Planning and Decision Making Systems Hamburg, M. The research project which produced this book concentrated on the problem of the design and development of statistical information systems that would provide quantitative information for effective management of university and large public libraries.  Since there is an inseparable need not only for improved library statistical data systems but also for the above-mentioned frameworks for rational planning and decision making, we have devoted considerable effort to the development of analytical models that might assist library administrators in making decisions that would maximize the flow of benefits imparted to the communities the library serves.  Some of the results of this model-building effort are repored in these pages. ', '949': 'Library Practice in Hospitals Bloomquist, H. According to a National Hospital Panel Survey conducted by the American Hospital Association in February 1970, 4,191 (72 percent) of the 5,820 community hospitals in the United States operated a library.  This percentage falls to 60 when only hospitals of less than 100-bed capacity are considered (1,990 libraries in 3,318 hospitals).  In the 4,191 libraries, one or more full-time staff members were found in only 1,054 (25 percent).  In even fewer, 928, was there supervision of the library by a professional librarian. Clearly there is a massive job to be done if these libraries are to perform properly their functions of health education and patient care. By \"community hospital\" we mean the nonfederal, short-term hospital providing general and selected special services, the hospital located at some distance from a large medical center and without teaching and research programs, such as a nursing school or internships.  Though the librarians of more sophisticated teaching institutions may well profit from the study of this book, it is written primarily for an audience of untrained, probably newly employed, individuals who find themselves supervising the hospital\\'s library and do not know where to begin. ', '950': 'The Crisis in Cataloging Osborn, A.D. A wise German librarian has linked the library administrator and the cataloger as working for the common aim of economy in work and cost coupled with better utilization of a library\\'s resources.  This aim, he thinks, is expressed in various kinds of cooperative work, of pooling interests, and of setting standards. It is to be developed prudently, he says, with the objectives setting limitations in such a way that more values will not be destroyed than are created. This ideal he set out in a chapter entitled \"Tasks for the future.\"  There was a time, and not so very far back, when the library administrator and the cataloger worked side by side.  In the more immediate past, however, the two have become separated, so that their closer collaboration does need to be set down as a task for the future, the immediate future at that. Many new problems of administration have served to busy the administrator, and most catalogers have had more work than enough, with the result that administrators have come to know less and less of cataloging, and catalogers have come to know less and less about general library administration.  The situation now is that the administrator will be forced to pay more attention to cataloging because it has become a major problem field. ', '951': 'The Historical Background of Departmental and Collegiate Libraries Thompson, L. In spite of the great volume of material dealing with departmental and collegiate libraries that has appeared in library periodicals and books on university and college library administration, there has been relatively little original thought on the subject and virtually no historical treatment to provide an adequate background for solution of problems which have their roots in a former generation.  Most of the literature has been either repetition of the old arguments for and against this type of library organization or statements of how this or that institution has faced its peculiar problems.  Except for contemporary accounts of early American scholars describing the attempts to transplant the German seminar library to American soil and reports on a few large university libraries, there is no account of the conditions which brought about and for many years invigorated the departmental system.  An evaluation of trends in the history of departmental libraries over the last three-quarters of a century should prove to be a valuable supplement to other information in the hands of surveyors and administrators who are interested in abolishing, establishing, continuing, or amalgamating departmental libraries in a given institution.

The increasing growth and complexities of research libraries are natural consequences of the growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of knowledge. Librarians have tried to amass more and more knowledge in the form of books for the benefit of the diverse interests of their clienteles.  Their success in this activity has been reflected in the increasing difficulties of identifying satisfactorily what they have.  The processes of cataloging, classifying, and related technical routines have become increasingly complex and expensive.  The processes are of such a nature that the cost for adding each new item to a large library is, on the average, potentially if not actually, higher than that for its predecessor.  The total proportion of the budgets of large research libraries that is spent for the processing of material, as distinguished from the costs of its purchase or its direct servicing, is now such as to give librarians pause for fear a day may come when nearly all the money available to large libraries will be spent in processing material, and little will be left to service the collection or to buy new books!

An industrial society has an open class stratification system; it offers some an opportunity to rise, but it offers no guarantee against downward social mobility.  Compared to other types of societies, this one demands a wider variety of higher level skills and thus generates much pressure against the forces that in all societies tend to keep the individual in his original caste or class.  Much of the resulting mobility is based on a radical change which has taken place in the occupational structure of modern industrial societies, one which neither Marx nor orthodox economists anticipated, an expansion of the demand for professional and technical skills of a high order. Thus not only are individuals competing with one another in their efforts to rise in the class system, but occupations, too, are engaged in the same competition and may move up or down in power, prestige, or income.

The present paper will first deal with some of the objectives, etiology, and requirements of the library network as it overtakes and embraces co-operation. Next, in this context of network development, a number of activities involving special libraries will be reviewed by way of illustration and example.  The greatest proportion of special library interrelationships are, on the surface at least, random and  informal.

An effort is made to utilize part of welfare economics to suggest which groups of library users will provide the greatest return to society.. An evaluation of the traditional library functions of education, information, and leisure suggests that libraries should direct their resources toward educational activities and not toward recreation when public monies are involved.. A case can be made for subsidizing the library activities of school-age children, other explicitly involved in education, disadvantages minority groups and governmental officials and staff.. Since public and school libraries produce and distribute essentially the same services, it is an uneconomic use of the communities' resources to maintain two separate institutions, one of which imposes costs on the other as children are forced to use public library facilities due to school library inadequacies.. \", '958': 'The Review Article: Its Characteristics and Problems Virgo, Julie A. The characteristics and problems associated with the review literature in the sciences were examined.. Three major classes of review articles were identified: (1) the annual review which aims to provide a systematic record of the contributions made within the previous year, (2) the critical review which selectively evaluates contributions to the solution of a common research problem, and (3) data compilations which are concerned with facts and findings rather than the opinions of the authors of papers from which the data are taken..

It is rather surprising that behavioral scientists have not discovered libraries much sooner in their search for institutional environments suited for the testing of theoretical hypotheses. Librarians and their assistants respect research and scholarship and are inclined to go far beyond the call of duty in helping the investigator, even when they are skeptical (rightfully, in most instances) of the usefulness of such research for the improvement of their own organizations. Data and related information are necessarily treated with greater precision and discipline in libraries than in factories and most bureaucratic offices; therefore, significant results can often be obtained with smaller samples and in shorter periods of observation.  People working in libraries do not feel they should curtail disclosures about basic processes.  Elsewhere professional employees are obligated to preserve trade secrets from competitors or to suppress facts which might be considered scandalous by legislative committees.  At least as important to an investigator is the fact that one or more libraries almost always lie close at hand - there could hardly be any more convenient institution.

In discussing the information needs of the scientist, I shall not limit myself to those for which library work is immediately relevant; in fact, a good part of this paper will call attention to the importance of those aspects of scientific communication that take place outside libraries and, indeed, outside literature.

An indexing or classification system should be judged by the retrieval results it produces, namely, the extent to which it brings forth relevant material and rejects the irrelevant.  Thus, well-designed experiments should permit judging the relative merits of different classification schemes. This notion, although self-evident, had remarkably little impact on the field of library science prior to the 1950's.  During that decade, the first controlled experiments on information retrieval were performed, and these mark a turning point in the history of classification research.  For the first time, experimental procedure and the rules of scientific evidence became of critical importance to indexing and classification.

In the earliest item (1905) in the bibliography here presented, Fletcher challenges the right of the dictionary catalog to be the overwhelmingly predominant type of catalog in libraries.  He questions its advocates' claim that it best meets a library's needs.  He advocates a divided catalog such as the one at Amherst because, for one thing, the separate catalog can more readily be used in conjunction with bibliographies in the subject fields.  We find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography (Harris, 1957).  Fletcher's article seems to have been followed by more than thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subject of the divided catalog.  During that period there were probably some divisions of catalogs at some libraries but, as Thom (q.v.) indicates, the greatest period of such activity started in 1937.  Our survey of the literature on the divided catalog corroborates this since 1938 in the year in which the steady stream of papers on the subject began. \", '974': 'Cost Survey: Cost of Ordering, Cataloging, and Preparations in Southern California Libraries MacQuarrie, C.

We found from the preliminary survey that book selection statistics were extremely difficult to determine, since all the professional staff in the libraries concerned participated in book selection, with the chief librarian performing most of it.  As a result, the cost of book selection was exceedingly high and threw the cost of ordering out of proportion. ', '975': \"Why Allocate? Bach, H.

Limited physical space expansion, an administrative consideration in every library, becomes a stringent factor in the planning of special libraries.  While public and college libraries may have several decades of growth possibility when they take possession of a building or area, it is indeed a fortunate industrial library whose stacks are not overcrowded after five years of establishment in new quarters.  Industrial floorspace is too greatly in demand to devote more effort to the possible future growth of the library.\\tWeeding or storage requirements, therefore, are far more immediate considerations to the special industrial library administrators than they are to administrators of other types of libraries.  The limits of expansion are usually apparent earliest in the serials collections of industrial libraries because so much current technical data is published first in scientific and technical periodicals.

In an effort to develop a simple method for librarians to employ to measure and evaluate author catalogue use, the Library Management Research Unit tested a survey design in four varying libraries.. The reader was asked to note details of items not found in the catalogue, the source of the reference, and his status.. The items were then checked by library staff to discover the cause of \"failure\".. Library staff interviewed samples of catalogue users to determine the overall rate of \"failure\", the cooperation (with \"Catalogue Query Slips\") rate, and the action readers proposed to take in order to obtain the item(s) not found in the catalogue..

The measurement and evaluation of reference service has been more often discussed than attempted.  In fact, the literature of this subject has itself spawned a fair-sized literature of review. Admittedly, the task is formidable.  As compared with other library activities such as circulation, acquisitions, and cataloging, reference service is ill-defined, with little agreement on its component parts.  Is inter-library lending an integral part of reference work because many reference librarians are responsible for it?  Formal instruction in the use of books and libraries?  The supervision of reference reading rooms?  The preparation of indexes?  And having decided what the genus \"reference librarian\" does, how can one readily determine the effectiveness of his work or its impact?  Reference librarians may have acted rather blindly in approaching their elephant of a problem, but it is undeniably a big one.

Unmistakable signs are pointing the way toward the creation sometime soon of a national information network in the United States.  The concept of a national network implies the interconnection of existing information systems and libraries through communications.  Certainly one of the great strengths of this nation is the great array of intellectual, scholarly, and research resources to be found in its libraries and information centers. Without integration and close cooperation, however, these resources will remain a series of separate, insulated institutions.  But if maximum communication can be established among them, this array can be converted into a national resource of immense value to citizens throughout the country.

Librarians have tried replacing some of their books and journal files with microfilm copies or other microforms in order to save valuable space in the bookstacks, instead of or in addition to extension of the stack area, decentralization, compact shelving, separate storage warehouse, or any of the other solutions to the storage problem discussed in earlier chapters.  As a final paper, this solution for the storage of library materials will be discussed.  Although the distinct forms will not often be designated, \"microform\" is used here to mean the four forms most common in the United States: 35 mm. roll microfilm, microfiche (now standardized in the United States and Great Britain at 4 by 6 inches) and the two micro-opaque forms - 3 by 5 inch Microcard, and 6 by 9 inch Microprint.

Theory and practice regarding patterns of decision- making in libraries have been relatively neglected aspects of library administration.  Yet the decisions by which a library attempts to control its operations are of major importance to its welfare and effectiveness.  Recent theories in management and social psychology have addressed themselves to the implications of participative management and group decision-making, and their findings appear to have important applications to libraries, not the least of which is personnel development.

It is only in the last eight or ten years that the numerical aspects of bibliography have attracted attention, although some of the numerical regularities that occur in bibliography have been known for thirty or forty years.  Results are, therefore, still meager and applications are still few.  Moreover, most of the work so far reported has been limited to numerical analysis of the literature of the natural sciences.  This is in part because the secondary sources in the natural sciences are the best organized and so provide the most accessible data; in part because the literature of the natural sciences are the least restricted by linguistic barriers; and in part because the proposed world- wide systems, such as those advocated in the UNISIST report, offer an immediate field of application in the design of economic and efficient systems based on the results of numerical bibliographic analysis.  However, the field of possible application is gradually widening: serious efforts are now being made to organize the more diffused literatures of the social sciences, for example.

Personal interviews of a half-hour or more in length were held with 1,151 people selected at random in different counties scattered over the United States. The sample was designed so as to represent all adult persons living in private households. By this tested method the survey gathered information concerning the amount and the kind of use people make of the public library and what changes or extension of library service people in general would prefer.

The concept of the core collection in a large library is not new. The thought behind such a concept is to provide a separation of the more frequently used volumes from those that are infrequently used.  There have been, however, difficulties in determining what volumes are to be included within the core collection.  It is usually necessary to establish a committee or group of professional people who determine, usually by enumeration, those volumes that should be included in the core collection. Often the results of such a determination merely reflect the opinions of the individuals, and although valid in many cases as desirable reading, the core collection that results may not be a reflection of user requirements. \", '1020': \"IFLA - Communications - FIAB Humphreys, K. The traditional pattern of organization of national and university libraries, apart from those in Germany or affected by German practice, was imposed by the weight given to the processing divisions.. The order department, which in university libraries did not include experts in book-selection, was not considered to be of comparable importance with the major department -- the cataloguing room, which also housed the classifiers.. Other divisions would be concerned with particular types of material -- maps, state papers or official documents, manuscripts, oriental books -- and would be largely autonomous with regard to acquisition and cataloguing.. The reading room staff were mainly employed in assisting readers to use the catalogue and in answering queries of a very specialized nature on the library's collections, especially on manuscripts or early printed books:  they rarely dealt with the general bibliographical or reference type of enquiry which is put to present-day reference librarians.. In these circumstances members of staff tended to become expert in the work of their own department and not be invited to take any part in the activities of another.. Divisions between the various kinds of work were therefore hard and fast and the structure of the library's organization could become similarly rigid.. It must be appreciated that this is a generalization and that many libraries were more fluid in their approach. Nonetheless this conservative view of the library's function tended to freeze the administration into this form.. An expert in a particular subject field often undertook research in the subject outside the library and might occasionally be asked to deal with a reader enquiring about an aspect of his field, but usually he would not make much use of his expertise in connection with his library duties, unless of course he was appointed as a paleographer, orientalist or linguist. The appointment of subject specialists may therefore necessitate a complete re-modelling of the staff organization if their influence is to extend beyond the bounds of the old departments. \", '1021': \"The Subject Specialist in National and University Libraries, with Special Reference to Book Selection Danton, J.P.

That is, these two, and only these two, commonly collect over a very broad spectrum, and in depth, material which makes possible the creation of new knowledge. Herein lies the paramount importance of these libraries to society if it be granted, as it is here assumed, that almost no field of human endeavor can advance without resort to the recorded past.  It is this twin aspect of the activity of these scholarly libraries - collecting simultaneously in breadth and in depth - which produces most of their major problems.

The force of this sense of constriction has been somewhat mitigated in all but the copyright libraries by the general lack of funds available for book purchasing, and by the increasing price of books.

My goal is not discussion of the content of science or even a humanistic analysis of its relations.

This aim was never realized, because it soon became evident that the social structure of the factory interlocked with, and often mirrored, that of the small isolated town in which it was situated.

This paper presents a conceptualization of information as related to the decision problems of the recipient.

The amount of information in a purposeful state is explicitly defined in terms of the probabilities of choice of the available courses of action. The amount of information in a message is defined as the difference between the amount of information in the purposeful state following the message, and the amount of information in the purposeful state preceding the message.  The amount of instruction in a purposeful state is defined in terms of the efficiencies of the available courses of action; and the amount of motivation is defined in terms of the values of the objectives.\\tThe amounts of instruction and motivation in a message are defined, just as information is, by comparing the amounts in a purposeful state before and after receipt of the message.

This concept can be generalized to express the value of the state to some other individual. ', '1038': 'Management Misinformation Systems Ackoff, R.L. Five assumptions commonly made by designers of management information systems are identified.

To overcome these assumptions and the deficiencies which result from them, a management information system should be imbedded in a management control system.

Several authors have proposed using scoring models for prescriptive analysis of the R and D project selection decision problem.  This research indicates that these models do not meet with important practical requirements.  For example, many authors recommend a multiplicative index, over an additive index, in order to generate a wide range of project scores.  The additive index is shown to have important advantages over the multiplicative index. The most serious shortcoming in the models, however, is the relatively arbitrary fashion in which the models have been constructed and the failure of the model builders to recognize the impact of certain structural considerations on resulting project scores.  Comparative analyses relating project rankings produced by scoring models to rankings produced by a profitability index and by a linear programming model demonstrate that the performance of the scoring model is highly sensitive to decisions made during the development of the model.  Considerations such as (1) the underlying distributions of project data, (2) time preferences, (3) the number of ranking intervals or categories, and (4) the width of the intervals, all have important implications for final project scores and associated rankings.

A suitability rating system, based on these criteria, is used by the author to rate twenty-six management science models for their suitability of use in R&D project selection decision making.

There is no doubt that eventually standards would have been designed for machine-readable bibliographic records, character sets, and codes for place and language.  MARC accelerated standardization and still more important, the standards are being set and agreed to be a large segment of the library community. The cooperation among the producers and users of bibliographic description has been a rewarding experience. ', '1044': 'Mathematical Taxonomy Jardine, N. In this book we give a mathematical account of some of the methods of data simplification which are involved in or suggested by the practice of biological taxonomy.  The computable methods derived are offered as potentially useful tools for taxonomists, rather than as substitutes for their activities. Superficially similar problems of data simplification arise in pattern recognition and in the various sciences which make substantial use of classificatory systems:  biological taxonomy, ecology, psychology, linguistics, archaeology, sociology, etc.  But more detailed examination shows that the kinds of classification used and the kinds of data on which they are based differ widely from science to science.  Whilst we recognize that some of the methods described here, particularly in Part II of the book, are more widely applicable, we have deliberately limited discussion to biological taxonomy.  The emphasis throughout is on the clarification of the mathematical properties of methods of automatic classification and of the conditions under which their application is valid, so that anyone who wishes to apply the methods in other fields shall be aware of their limitations, and of the lines along which they may profitably be developed and modified.

The word communication will be used here in a very broad sense to include all of the procedures by which one mind may affect another.  This, of course, involves not only written and oral speech, but also music, the pictorial arts, the theatre, the ballet, and in fact all human behavior.  In some connections it may be desirable to use a still broader definition of communication, namely, one which would include the procedures by means of which one mechanism (say automatic equipment to track an airplane and to compute its probably future positions) affects another mechanism (say a guided missile chasing this airplane). The language of this memorandum will often appear to refer to the special, but still very broad and important, field of the communication of speech; but practically everything said applies equally as well to music of any sort, and to still or moving pictures, as in television.

The work to which this chapter forms a preface arises out of a deep and prolonged dissatisfaction which the author has felt with both past and present theories of the structure of language.  This dissatisfaction may be understood more readily, and the suggestions which make up the body of this work may appear in clearer perspective, if I begin with a few remarks of an autobiographical nature. The intrinsic importance of these remarks is minimal, but they may provide a useful background for what follows. ', '1047': 'Measurement of Meaning Osgood, C.E. The scientific study of language has been developing with particular rapidity during the past decade or so.  One thinks immediately of the basic work of Zipf and Skinner, of the developments in information theory, in concept formation, in second language learning, in work association research, and generally of the increasing integration of the psychological and linguistic approaches as reflected in the activities of the Social Science Research Council Committee on Linguistics and Psychology.  Almost every new issue of a social science journal brings additional evidence of this heightened activity. A significant aspect of much of this development has been the devising and application of new quantitative measurement techniques. During the past six or seven years, a group of us at the University of Illinois has been concentrating on the development of an objective measure of meaning, and this book is largely a progress report of that research. ', '1048': 'Measurement of Satisfaction in Work and Retirement Smith, P.C. The focus of the book can be summed up in its subtitle: A Strategy for the Study of Attitudes.  This strategy is developed by devoting considerable attention to the nature of the concept of satisfaction, and, particularly, to the requirements for scientifically adequate measures of satisfaction.  In fact, it is the emphasis on a comprehensive set of requirements for sound measurement, rather than on just one or two elements of it, which is the quality that sets this book apart from any previous report in the area of job satisfaction. Not the least of the values of this book is its basic utility for both academicians and practitioners.  For the former, it should serve as a powerful spur and guide to further fundamental research on the nature and correlates of satisfaction.  For too many years we in this area have been plagued by inadequately conceived and poorly developed measuring devices.  This has led to a plethora of studies each using a different scale or measuring instrument.  As a consequence, this has opened the door for almost anyone to claim the solution for making sense of the jigsaw pattern of findings relating to satisfaction.  At the very least, the present volume should provide researchers with a thoroughly developed measuring instrument that will allow comparability of results across studies.  If so, this may well bring some meaningful order to the present rather chaotically structured literature on job satisfaction.

There is probably no measurement task which public servants face which is more difficult than that of measuring the quality of service.  It is as difficult to measure the quality of hospital service, or of schools, or of social welfare programs, as it is to determine the quality of library service.  It is equally as difficult to decide what actions to take in order to improve service. Legislators, urban and regional planners, consultants, boards of trustees, accrediting teams, librarians, and a host of other decision makers must act on the basis of some conclusions about the quality of service offered by library systems.  This handbook is intended for these groups, and especially for practicing librarians.  The pervasiveness of the problem across all public service institutions, however, leads us to hope that the handbook will be of interest to other groups.

The innovation is a medical one, a drug which physicians use in everyday practice; the setting is in the Midwestern United States in the 1950's.  This study gives a glimpse of one small part of the great changes that have recently occurred within medicine and thus is of specific interest to the medical profession and its allied institutions. But more generally, the question of the spread of an innovation is of interest to all students of society.  Particularly in an age of change, and in our complex and massive society, an understanding of the way in which an innovation can spread - for better or worse! - constitutes important knowledge of man.

This book originally set out to be a kind of reporting-in-depth of the American Library Association Pre-Conference on Acquisitions held in Atlantic City in the summer of 1969 - a report embracing not only the essential content of the formal speeches, but also the floor discussions and after-hours bull sessions. Meanwhile, however, a closely similar treatment of the problem of how to buy library materials, long in process, suddenly shaped up and was published by ALA in November 1969.  This was Purchasing Library Materials in Public and School Libraries by Evelyn Hensel and Peter D. Veilette. A treatment of the acquisition process in college and university libraries was also taking shape at this time and became the January 1970 issue of Library Trends.

Belzer, J. Kurfeerst, M. Dym, E.D. Shirey, d.L. Bose, A. An experiment is described which attempts to derive quantitative indicators regarding the potential relevance predictability of the intermediate stimuli used to represent documents in information retrieval systems.  In effect, since the decision to peruse an entire document is often predicated upon the examination of one \"level of processing\" of the document (e.g., the citation and/or abstract), it became interesting to analyze the properties of what constitutes \"relevance\".  However, prior to such an analysis, an even more elementary step had to be made, namely, to determine what portions of a document should be examined. An evaluation of the ability of intermediate response products (IRPs), functioning as cues to the information content of full documents, to predict the relevance determination that would be subsequently made on these documents by motivated users of information retrieval systems, was made under controlled experimental conditions.  The hypothesis that there might be other intermediate response products (selected extracts from the document i.e., first paragraph, last paragraph, and the combination of first and last paragraph), that would be representative of the full document as the traditional IRPs (citation and abstract) was tested systematically.  The results showed that: 1. there is no significant difference among the several IRP treatment groups on the number of cue evaluations of relevancy which match the subsequent user relevancy decision on the document; 2. first and last paragraph combinations have consistently predicted relevancy to a higher degree that the other IRPs; 3. abstracts were undistinguished as predictors; and 4. the apparent high predictability rating for citations was not substantive. Some of these results are quite different than would be expected from previous work with unmotivated subjects.

The paper reports the results of a two week questionnaire survey of the use of biomedical periodical literature carried out at the UK National Lending Library in February 1969.  The survey was designated to discover the subject, date and language characteristics of the borrowed literature, the most frequently requested journals, and the most popular sources of references to biomedical publications. The loans were spread over 1,084 titles, although 9 per cent of the issues involved only 2 per cent of the titles.  The literature in most demand was less than one year old and in the case of medicine 50 per cent of the requests were for literature lss than 3 1/2 years old.  The half-life for the biological literature was somewhat longer at 5 3/4 years.  The majority of issues (87.8 per cent) involved English language periodicals. Overall, the principal sources of references to the requested literature were citation lists in other periodical articles.  Regarding the more recent literature, however, abstracting and indexing journals were the primary sources of information.  For medical references Index Medicus was the most used indexing publication, and for biological references Current Contents. ', '1056': \"Metropolitan Public Library Bundy, M.L.

Others include: (1) Instead of binding serials (journals are retained unbound for two to three years after publication, the period of heaviest use, and are then discarded and replaced by microform versions; (2) To preserve deteriorating materials; (3) Easing access to bulky materials such as newspapers; (4) To provide working copies of materials too delicate for continued use such as rare books; (5) to save money - in most cases the cost of an out-of-print set or serial backfile will be substantially less in microform than the cost of a full-size reprint or the cost of the original on the used book market; (6) Ease of acquisition - i.e., acquiring materials which would otherwise be difficult to acquire; (7) Mutilations reduced.

The referee system in science involves the systematic use of judges to assess the acceptability of manuscripts submitted for publication.

Other kinds of status-judges include teachers assessing the quality of work by students (and, as a recent institutional change, students officially assessing the quality of performance by teachers), critics in the arts, supervisors in industry and coaches and managers in sports.

This paper analyses the formation of a new discipline, molecular biology, from the development of phage work.  It argues that such social variables as the competitive position and relative status of each of the specialities or disciplines from which a new one is formed are not sufficient to explain phage work's development into the specialty of molecular biology.  Even though persons in physics, a field with high academic standing, decided to enter biology, which had a lower academic standing, and even though some recruiting of students occurred, these factors alone are not sufficient to account for the development of the specialty, particularly given the competitiveness of modern conditions.  In the emergence of molecular biology from phage work, the variables of status and competitive position, adduced by Professors Ben-David and Collins to explain the emergence of experimental psychology from the hybridization of physiology and philosophy, seem to be less important than other normal activities which occur in scientific development. \", '1064': 'Modern Manuscripts  A Practical Manual for Their Management, Care and Use Duckett, K.W.

Considerably more space is devoted to organizational structure than to the other topics, for two reasons:  First, more research has been conducted and more writings are available on organizational structure than on organizational goals (Chapter 2) and environment.  Second, the major schools of organizational analysis have fixed their interests on structural aspects of the organization, and thus, we may best evaluate these different approaches in the context of organizational structure.

This outline is based mainly on lectures given at the North-Western Polytechnic to students studying for the Library Association's Registration Examination in Classification and Cataloguing. It is hoped that it will help to meet the need, increasingly felt in recent years by students and teachers of the subject, for a reasonably simple textbook on Library Classification which takes account of the considerable developments which have occurred in the subject in the past 25 years.  As is well known, a great deal of this has been due to Dr. Ranganathan, and also, in more recent years, to Mr. B. C. Vickery.  As a result of these developments, a coherent theory of library classification has been established in each of its three major departments - in subject analysis, in notation, and in the alphabetical indexing of systematic orders.

This review of several thousand articles and books regarding the factors relating to job attitudes and the effect of job attitudes on work performance indicated much disagreement and confusion in the field.

One of the most intriguing problems of modern science is the obscure nature of its own growth.  Indeed, there are few notable scientists who have not, at one time or another, given serious thought to the questions of how their particular science has reached its present state and what will be the course of its future development.  These questions seem to be of such importance to scientists that they have emerged as fundamental scientific problems in their own right. Goffman and Newill have pointed out that the process by which ideas spread within a population of scientists possesses epidemiological properties and can therefore be investigated as an epidemic process.  Consequently, a new set of mathematical tools can be applied to the problem of explaining the nature of scientific development. In particular, this approach makes it possible to establish the relative importance of past lines of inquiry within a given area of scientific research, and to predict the future behavior of existing lines of investigation as well as the emergence of important new ones within the given area. The purpose of this communication is to demonstrate this method by applying it to the development of knowledge about mast cells.  In his recent comprehensive survey of this subject, Prof. Hens Selye has assembled a \"full bibliography\" in which \"every aspect of the mast cell is dealt with.\"  This bibliography constitutes ideal data for the application of epidemic theory to the spread of scientific ideas, since it provides us with  all the contributions to the subject area, from Ehrlich\\'s discovery of the mast cell in 1877 until 1963.

Penny, unpublished) have lent me a list of titles cited in the Journal of Ecology three or more times in 1955-56, and a similar list for 1965-66. There are 150 periodical titles in the two lists, but only forty-two (28%) appear in both.  Of the thirty-three titles cited nine or more times in either year, only eight (25%) attained that level in both, and twelve were cited less than three times in the other year.  The Kendall rank correlation coefficient between the two years is 0.18 and not significant. There is another major practical problem. The article assumes that the data analyzed to obtain aging or utility factors and Bradford sets are valid parameters of the relative value of the literature to the readers.  There is no mention of the type of data to use.  The reader who sought guidance from the earlier literature cited would find practical techniques described in which analyses of citation frequencies are used to calculate utilities discussed in terms of library use.  Krauze and Hillinger have discussed the difference between citations in one article and future citations to that article.  Their work implies a more complex relation between a and u than Brookes suggests.  In any case, the validity of citations for forecasting library consultations remains unproven, and there are prima facie reasons why the relationship is not necessarily close.  For example, one item in a list of references is often intended to lead to a chain of earlier papers.  Again, each citation represents an author's selection from a wider group most of which he has consulted in a library.  In neither case is there any inherent reason for similarity of age distribution or of pool of titles between the list of citations and the items read by the author or his readers. \", '1091': 'Effectiveness of Combining Title Words and Index Terms in Machine Retrieval Searches Fisher, H.L. Our experiment was based on volume 24 of Nuclear Science Abstracts (NSA) which contains about 53,000 citations; we used the generalized file-management system, Master Control, which can operate in either an inverted or a linear search mode. The inverted mode uses a table composed of the unique vocabulary contained in one or more data elements, along with all record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  For example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus the record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  For example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus the record numbers in which each word was found.  (In Master Control, a word is defined as any set of characters bounded on either side by a legal separator such as a blank, period, comma, colon, etc.)  On the other hand, in a linear search mode the data element is compared with the profile word, character by character, which results in a prohibitively time-consuming process for large data bases. We chose the inverted-table technique because of the large amount of data to be searched.  Individual tables were constructed from the titles of the articles, NSA index terms, and titles and index terms combined.  NSA index terms are controlled by the Euratom Thesaurus, as revised for NSA. We used two criteria in the study.  First, the questions had to be of real interest to laboratory personnel.  Some of the questions had actually been submitted by other members of the staff, to be run concurrently on the same data base on an SDI basis.  The others were especially constructed by the authors for this experiment.  Second, citations obtained were to be considered good (or relevant) only if they actually pertained to the subject in question; otherwise, they were to be considered \"false drops,\" regardless of the number of words matched between the profile and the citation.

The basic weaknesses of these libraries fall into four categories: inadequate collections, inadequate personnel, inadequate space, and the absence of any practical indexing system to facilitate use of collections that do exist. Failure to deal with these problems does not reflect lack of interest but rather lack of stimulation to do so and absence of any concerted source of guidance.  In response to requests for such guidance PMI has undertaken a community hospital library development project in co-operation with the New England Regional Medical Library Service (NERMLS) at the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine.  This report is concerned with the first phase of this project - namely, the formulation of a list consisting of a minimal number of textbooks and journals that can function as the core for a medical library. Explanatory letters and questionnaires were sent to 400 specialists representing 50 areas of medical practice, including the basic sciences.  The specialists, chosen from regions throughout the country, were requested to recommend two textbooks and two journals in their area of special interest that they considered to be the most basic and fundamentally useful for practitioners.  It was also requested that recommendations be made in order of preference. ', '1148': 'The New Industrial State Galbraith, J.K. During the fifties and sixties it had become customary to depict the economic system of the United States, along with its European and Japanese counterparts, as an accomplishment unique since the Creation.  This volume departed from the accustomed cheering.  It is my impression that the adult reader was always more skeptical than the economists of the neo-Keynesian nirvana.  Economic life was not meant to be that easy.  And perhaps some sensed what I here urge, that what was called success was less what served the individual than what served the goals of great industrial and military bureaucracies which had come, the economic myth notwithstanding, to comprise so large a part of the economic system.  Still, who could tell that a herald of such news would be welcomed - or even heard. ', '1149': \"The New Librarianship A Challenge for Change Wasserman, P. Among the avenues explored were the following: the attractions the field holds for those now in it and those who might be drawn to it; the personality of those in the occupation and in its various subfields and work roles; the characteristics and perspectives of the institutional administrators; supply and demand facets of the manpower problem; organizational relationships in libraries and information centers; library education as a professionalizing and socializing force; and the implications of network development for manpower planning.  Central to the study rationale was the notion that librarianship should be viewed not as a static institution committed solely to traditional objectives, but as one with the capacity to be responsive to changing environmental requirements. It was hoped that from the intelligence gathered from these inquiries certain of the significant dimensions of the field's manpower concerns would be illuminated and proposals to influence future development would be drawn.  Thus, while the investigations were in the nature of more basic research, their ends were committedly pragmatic. \", '1150': 'New Patterns of Management Mityaev, V.A.

The first systematic attempt to assess the size of this problem, carried out by the Aslib Research Department, suggests the actual figure is more than double this, and the consequent cost to the nation to be measurable in millions of pounds. We put questions to 647 scientists engaged in industrial, academic or government research, including chemists, physicists, biologists, psychologists and mathematicians.  One question was: \"Have you, during your current research, discovered in the literature information which you wish you had had at the beginning of your project?\"  To this, 144 of them (22 per cent) replied that they had.

In this setting, managerial decision making in the library has become an unenviably difficult task. Furthermore, the new technologies and new techniques which offer great opportunities for library planners and  managers make even more difficult the use of traditional, intuitive approaches.

Authors are often convinced that the particular subjects with which they are dealing are more significant than the world has acknowledged. We cheerfully make this claim for organization theory.  However much organizations occupy the thoughts of practicing executives and administrators, and however many books for these practitioners have been written about them, the theory of organizations occupies an insignificant place in modern social science.  Most current psychology and sociology textbooks do not devote even a short chapter to the subject of formal organizations.  The Handbook of Social Psychology (Lindzey, 1954) contains chapters on small groups, mass media, \"industrial social psychology\" (with only passing references to organizations), leadership, and voting behavior.

We lack the systematic evidence that eventually must come, but there are illustrative studies cited to indicate that the propositions which are neither time- nor space-bound.

Consequently, epidemic theory can be applied to the study of any process in which information is transmitted within a population.. The members of such populations need not be human beings but could be micro-organisms or even machines.. The fundamental notion of stability of an epidemic process is introduced and a stability theorem is derived.. A mechanism, called an information retrieval process, which instigates an epidemic process is defined, certain general properties of the mechanism are established and the means of controlling it are discussed.. Pontryagin's maximum principle is applied to the problem of achieving optimal control of an epidemic process and it is shown that stability of the process is equivalent to stability in the sense of Lyapunov.. This result makes it possible to determine the conditions for stability without knowledge of the solution of the differential equations which represent the process.. \", '1202': 'Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis Duda, R.O. Our purpose in writing this book has been to give a systematic account of major topics in pattern recognition, a field concerned with machine recognition of meaningful regularities in noisy or complex environments. The most prominent domain-independent theory is classification theory, the subject of Part I of this book.  Based on statistical decision theory, it provides formal mathematical procedures for classifying patterns once they have been represented abstractly as vectors. Attempts to find domain-independent procedures for constructing these vector representations have not yielded generally useful results.  Instead, every problem area has acquired a collection of procedures suited to its special characteristics.  Of the many areas of interest, the pictorial domain has received by far the most attention.  Furthermore, work in this area has progressed from picture classification to picture analysis and description. Part II of this book is devoted to a systematic presentation of these topics in visual scene analysis. ', '1203': 'Patterns in the Use of books in Large Research Libraries Fussler, H.H. The accumulative growth, without limit in ultimate size, of the general research library must produce stresses and strains that many institutions will find difficult to resolve.  The rising costs of space for library buildings and bookstacks; the scarcity of centrally located campus land; aesthetic and functional limitations on the heights, bulk, and areas of library buildings; and increasing complexity in the organization of materials and services for the efficient use of large research collections, are illustrative of some of these stresses and strains.

Since 1958 when the first edition of the present work was issued, additional studies, research programs and experimentation have contributed to changes in personnel work and the large area of human relations.

The present edition views all the aspects of personnel work in the context of the most useful of the newer developments. ', '1206': 'Personnel Utilization in Libraries A Systems Approach Ricking, M. In the late 1960s nearly all professions in the United States thought they faced severe shortages of manpower in their fields, both in professional and supporting areas.  Librarianship was not immune: there was more work to be done than existing staffs could do; there were budgeted professional vacancies that could not be filled.  And, concurrently, there were concerns being quietly expressed that some of the shortages could be ameliorated by a changed utilization of existing manpower. It was at this time and out of these concerns that Julius R. Chitwood, then president of the Illinois Library Association, appointed an ad hoc Committee on Manpower Training and Utilization to study patterns of staff assignments and to recommend to library administrators more effective ways of utilizing professional staff.  After examining the use of professional staff in a few libraries, however, it became clear to this committee of volunteer researchers that they could not do the job which needed doing.  It was also clear that a need was there, that a small segment of the library manpower problem could be more fully explored, that the results of a serious study in Illinois might have national implications, and that the resources for such a study should be sought.

There is the matter of audience; of the probable delay between acceptance and publication; of article format (letter, review, standard research report). If the article is potentially controversial, the author may estimate its chances of being accepted by different journals.

Library buildings house library collections of various kinds, chiefly books and other printed matter; seating accommodations and other facilities for library users; quarters for the library staff that acquires, catalogues, and serves the collections; and, in addition, architectural or what is preferably known as non-assignable space.

This book is intended to help campus planners, architects, and librarians in the early stages of the planning process. Three aspects of the problem deserve more careful treatment than they have received.  These are: the effects of automation and electronics on planning; the overall organization of service patterns; and, the relevance of other audiovisual learning media. This is a book about the planning process, not the details of all parts of a building.  It will not tell you which floor covering is best, which light fixtures to use or which kind of library shelving to buy.  These matters are treated in detail by Metcalf.  It will, however, try to tell you how to go about solving these and the many other problems planners face.

The notion of a Plan that guides behavior is, again not entirely accidentally, quite similar to the notion of a program that guides an electronic computer.  In order to discover how to get the Image into motion, therefore, we reviewed once more the cybernetic literature on the analogies between brains and computers, between minds and programs. Our fundamental concern, however, was to discover whether the cybernetic ideas have any relevance for psychology.  The men who have pioneered in this area have been remarkably innocent about psychology - the creatures whose behavior they want to simulate often seem more like a mathematician's dream than like living animals.  But in spite of all the evidence, we refused to believe that ignorance of psychology is a cybernetic prerequisite or even an advantage.  There must be some way to phrase the new ideas so that they can contribute to and profit from the science of behavior that psychologists have created.  It was the search for that favorable intersection that directed the course of our year-long debate. \", '1214': 'The Practice of Management Drucker, P.F.

This book does not exclude from its aims the advancement of the frontier of knowledge; it hopes, indeed, to make some contribution to it. But its first aim is to narrow the gap between what can be done and what is being done, between the leaders in management and the average.

Twenty years later, with chain procedure established as one of the standard techniques, BNB again pioneered a new approach to subject indexing when it adopted PRECIS from its first issues of 1971. To explain why this change was felt to be necessary, we have to consider these indexing systems in the light of the new approaches to handling bibliographic data which have developed over the past decade of so.  Two forces, in particular, have affected both descriptive cataloguing and subject indexing during this period; firstly, the introduction of computers; secondly, and concomitantly, the development of bibliographic data exchange networks, of which MARC is, perhaps, the primary example. In some respects, PRECIS represents a parallel development in the field of subject indexing.  Traditionally, indexing systems have also tended to be dominated by the concept of a most significant term which, once identified by the indexer, would be offered as the user\\'s access point to the alphabetical file.  This applied most obviously to subject heading systems.  A good deal of Cutter\\'s \"Rules for a dictionary catalog\" is devoted to the problem of identifying this most significant term in a compound heading and presenting it as the user\\'s access point, even when this entailed a distortion of natural language, and the production of inverted headings.  The unselected component would then be lost as an entry word, unless the indexer also created a further heading or headings, in which case none of these headings would be co-extensive with the subject of the document.

Since the first edition of Library of Congress subject headings appeared 60 years ago, American and other libraries have increasingly relied on this list as the chief authority -- if not the sole basis -- for subject cataloging.  There can be no quarrel about the practical necessity for such a labor-saving, worry-reducing work, nor--abstractly--about its value as a global standardizing agent, a means for achieving some uniformity in an area that would otherwise be chaotic. Undoubtedly, it is a real boon to scholars, as well as to ordinary readers, to find familiar, fairly constant headings in subject catalogs as far removed geographically as Washington, DC and Lusaka, Zambia.  Knowledge and scholarship are, after all, universal.  And a subject-scheme should, ideally, manage to encompass all the facets of what has been printed and subsequently collected in libraries to the satisfaction of the worldwide reading community.  Should, that is.  But in the realm of headings that deal with people and cultures--in short, with humanity--the LC list can only \"satisfy\" parochial, jingoistic Europeans and North Americans, white-hued, at least nominally Christian (and preferably Protestant) in faith, comfortably situated in the middle and higher-income brackets, largely domiciled in suburbia, fundamentally loyal to the Established Order, and heavily imbued with the transcendent, incomparable glory of Western civilization.  Further, it reflects a host of untenable--indeed, obsolete and arrogant--assumptions with respect to young people and women.

Semantic text analysis could be described from the point of view of someone with a different \"conception of the world\" - e.g. the text of very meaningful article does not contain, in fact, any information for people who are not specialists in the given mathematic field.

The result is that international documents are a puzzlement to the general librarian, and a source of frustration to the ill informed administrator; a situation exacerbated by the present general tendency of library school curricula to ignore the question of international documents except for cursory mention in one or at most two sessions of a general course in government documents to which relatively few students are exposed.

The two articles selected are on two aspects of the subject, namely, filing problems, and comparative costs. The sixth section, Copyright, contains an article from the legal point of view.  The more traditional library view of copyright has been ably represented by Verner Clapp in an article cited in the section on additional readings. The seventh section, Information Retrieval Testing, is a subject which has excited the attention of but few librarians, yet its influence on subject indexing could in time prove considerable.

This book is intended to present the flavor and philosophy of medical librarianship to the student or novice.  If it gives a new perspective to some practicing librarians or administrators in health science organizations, so much the better. If it were ever possible to think of medical libraries in isolation, it is so no longer.  One must conceive of them as part of a medical system, and indeed as part of a system that goes beyond the narrow confines of medicine as practiced by a single physician for a single patient.  It extends into the health sciences as represented by dentists, pharmacists, nurses, veterinarians, medical technologists, medical associates and dozens of others, some not yet possessing a clear identity.  It includes research, education and practice.  In addition to the clinical sciences, the system involves the preclinical ones and preventive medicine and public health. Increasingly, socioeconomic considerations have moved into the mainstream of medicine. ', '1250': \"Reader in Research Methods for Librarianship Bundy, M.L. The fundamental purpose of this volume is to assist its reader to genuinely perceive the nature of scholarship and its relationship to the goals of librarianship.  Viewed in this way, and perhaps as antidote to the more rigidly formalistic treatments of the technical matters of research, the editors' concern here has been less with the rituals and far more with the fundamental nature of intellectual inquiry and its societal contribution, with the modes of analysis, the habits of thought and expression which characterize scholarship and the scholar. Another primary purpose has been to put research into a context which clearly depicts the task of the researcher, and so illuminates realistically not only the rigor and the discipline, but the human triumphs and joys which derive from its accomplishment.  Seen thus, as a dynamic field fit for the adventurer of the mind, perhaps it may succeed in enticing more to its fold from among those in librarianship with imaginative and creative capacity, who have not before held this perspective of research. \", '1251': 'Reader in Technical Services Applebaum, E.

This report describes the results of a study of a practical method of preparing Library of Congress card catalog data in machine form for (1) the automatic typesetting of cards and book catalogs, and (2) distribution to other libraries throughout the country for all foreseeable bibliographic and typographic applications of such data, including preparation of local catalogs.. The first step of the method proposed is to type the card data on a perforated tape typewriter in a way which identifies all of the items on the card.. After the data is edited and corrected, it is processed by a computer to form (1) catalog card typesetting tapes, (2) the National Union Catalog, (3) Library of Congress Books, Subjects Catalog, magnetic tape catalog files, and a master magnetic or perforated paper tape record copy for distribution.. The procedure also allows the recording of data which does not now appear on Library of Congress cards, should studies find that the value of the data exceeds the cost of recording it.. A demonstration was performed in which cards were typed to produce perforated tape records.. These record tapes were automatically converted to a variety of output forms ranging from phototypeset catalog cards and book catalog entries to tape typewriter and line printer produced catalog cards..

Stock control has been defined by Buckland as \"the managerial problem of organising the physical availability of books in relation to readers\".  While it has long been recognised that only a proportion of the stock of academic libraries is actively used academic library buildings grow both more expensive and approach capacity fullness with remarkable speed.  In certain cases some new buildings are full even before they have left the design-board stage.  It is difficult to avoid the conclusion reached by R.B. Morris in 1963 that \\'in terms of long range perspective, responsible judgement suggests that there is no feasible choice before libraries other than a wide and continuous programme of \"selective book retirement\"\\'.  Library stock control has not received the attention it merits from librarians whose energy, time and resources have been more than fully committed by the problems of acquisition and the provision of an ever-increasing range of services for readers.  Early investigations of this issue have tended to be theoretical and Carol Seymour in her review \"Weeding the Collection\" put forward the view that \"a librarian should be able to begin his plan for weeding even if the day seems far off when weeding will be necessary... He also knows the sorts of information tools he will need to have at hand when the day does dawn on his overgrown garden\".  The Pebul Report summarised the position in a remarkably appropriate metaphor when it observed that \"weeding the bookstock\" in academic libraries was the \"ungrasped nettle.\" ', '1254': 'Report of an Investigation on Literature Searching by Research Scientists Martin, J.

This volume continues the account of the Aslib-Cranfield project as given in the \"Final Report of the First Stage of an Investigation into the Comparative Efficiency of Indexing Systems\".  The major portion of the two years spent on this present stage has been involved with the analysis of the considerable amount of data which was obtained from the main test programme.  A difficulty in this work was in deciding on the type of analysis which would be most likely to yield valuable information.  In order to keep this volume within reasonable limits, it has been necessary to select from the analysis that was done, and even so in many cases only brief examples are given.  The major emphasis has been placed on the reasons for failure to retrieve source documents, for this is considered to give some of the most interesting results of the project and has not, to our knowledge, been previously attempted.  Of possible equal importance, but certainly more difficult to evaluate, is the reason for the retrieval of non-relevant references.  This analysis has not been attempted within the present work, but will be one of the matters to be investigated in the continuation of the project.

This is related to the general growth in scientific activity as exemplified by increases in numbers of physicists and of expenditure on research.. The results of surveys aimed at ascertaining the needs or demands of users of the physics literature are considered, particularly where these reveal weakness in the present organization of information transfer, and the reactions of users to new services intended to remedy the deficiencies..

Foremost among the nationwide goals of the library community is the access to needed information resources for all persons in all locations in the U.S.  The perceived right of individuals to such access provides the foundation for national information planning. For each library, even the largest, the hope of adequately supplying its identified user groups has been greatly constrained by simultaneous inflation of both cost and quantity of materials. While future technological developments may well make possible on-line full text retrieval of all library materials at local terminals or the instantaneous remote \"publication\" of materials upon demand, the present situation requires more immediate solutions. ', '1259': 'Categories and Relators:  A New Scheme Perreault, J.M. If the (major) premise is accepted, that fully effective machine-strategization of a retrieval system depends upon the use of a (hierarchically) structural (but highly flexible) notation as the equivalent for the verbal access provided by either unitermic or articulated conceptual indicators, a faceted classification logically emerges as the desideratum. The two aspects of a structural notation most determinative here are hierarchicality and uniform use of general categories (the latter, not merely for the sake of uniformity as such, but as the means to a heightened flexibility).  These desiderata could of course be present on the \"idea plane\" alone; but without their being present notationally they do not furnish, to a mechanized retrieval system, the type of assistance it requires for optimal functioning. The second (minor) premise ought to be that the Universal Decimal Classification, being both hierarchical and general-categoric, provides the desired structurality.  But the melancholy fact is that this desideratum is not always satisfied, for instance when UDC uses direct division of a hierarchy when division by general category would be equally appropriate.

The collection includes (1) simple parent rings and (2) parent systems of more than one ring in which the rings are united by having one or more atoms in common.  It thus comparizes simple and \"fused\" (ortho- and ortho-peri-fused), or annelated, systems (including spiro forms),  but not systems like biphenyl or triphenylmethane, in which the rings are united only by valences or by atoms not belonging to the rings.  Some systems are included in which a polar valence is involved, e.g. the four-membered ring of betaine, since these are often shown in formulas as if true rings; but in such cases the presence of the polar bond is noted.  Polar bonds in metallic salts (e.g. calcium succinate) are disregarded as ring formers; so also are coordinate linkages (as in the chelate compounds).  The word \"system\" is used to mean a single ring or a combination of rings united one to another by atoms common to both. Except for some special reason, only systems representing known compounds of generally accepted structure, or definitely believed by authors to have a certain structure, are included.  The fact that a compound must have one or two alternative structures is not sufficient for the entry of a system based on either of them.  Where there is doubt about an entry a query (?) is inserted after the reference. ', '1262': 'The Rise of Anthropological Theory Harris, M. My main reason for writing this book is to reassert the methodological priority of the search for the laws of history in the science of man.  There is an urgency associated with this rededication, which grows in direct proportion to the increase in the funding and planning of anthropological research and especially to the role anthropologists have been asked to assume in the planning and carrying out of international development programs.  A general theory of history is required if the expansion of disposable research funds is to result in something other than the rapid growth in the amount of trivia being published in the learned journals.  The publishing of more and more about less and less is an acceptable consequence of affluence only if specialization does not lead to an actual neglect or even obfuscation of fundamental issues.

No code of cataloging could be adopted in all points by every one, because the libraries for study and the libraries for reading have different objects, and those which combine the two do so in different proportions.  Again, the preparation of a catalog must vary as it is to be manuscript or printed, and, if the latter, as it is to be merely an index to the library, giving in the shortest possible compass clues by which the public can find books, or is to attempt to furnish more information on various points, or finally is to be made with a certain regard to what may be called style.  Without pretending to exactness, we may divide dictionary catalogs into short-title, medium title, and full-title or bibliographic; typical examples of the three being, 1, the Boston Mercantile (1869) or the Cincinnati Public (1871); 2, the Boston Public (1861 and 1866), the Boston Athenaeum (1874-82); 3, the catalog now making by the Library of Congress.  To avoid the constant repetition of such phrases as \"the full catalog of a large library\" and \"a concise finding-list,\" I shall use the three words Short, Medium, and Full as proper names, with the preliminary caution that the Short family are not all the same size, that there is more than one Medium, and that Full may be Fuller and Fullest.  Short, if single-columned, is generally a title-a-liner; if printed in double columns, it allows the title occasionally to exceed one line, but not, if possible, two; Medium does not limit itself in this way, but it seldom exceeds four lines, and gets many titles into a single line.

My plan in this paper is to try to apply to the field of experimental psychology the analysis of the characteristics of science (and, more particularly, the structure of scientific revolutions) as conceptualized by T.S. Kuhn.  Kuhn has not been accepted without criticism, but that need not prevent us from using his book as a point of departure for discussion.  I assume that the reader will be familiar with Kuhn's analysis,so that only a sketchy summary of his position is necessary.  I will then take a brief look at some of the history of psychology, with special emphasis upon the major tenets of behaviorism.  Finally, I will advance some evidence to suggest that we may well be living in an era of revolution within psychology (as well as without). \", '1272': \"Is a Kuhnian Analysis Applicable to Psychology? Briskman, L.B. As my title might suggest, I wish to discuss some aspects of Palermo's recent paper.  The thesis which Palermo advocated is that Kuhn's view of scientific revolution is applicable to the recent history of experimental psychology, and that, in particular, experimental psychology has had two paradigms already, with the appropriate scientific revolution between them, and that the current behavioristic paradigm may well be in a state of Kuhnian crisis.  The present note is divided into three parts: the first questions Palermo's assertion that the transition from introspectionism to behaviorism was a standard Kuhnian paradigm-change; the second, closely tied to the first, challenges the assumption that behaviorism itself can really be seen as a Kuhnian paradigm; finally, the third supports Palermo's thesis that behaviorism is in a 'crisis-state' but advances an alternative account of the reasons for this. \", '1273': \"Bibliographical Statistics as a Guide to Growth Points in Science Meadows, A.J. O'connor, J.G. Efforts have been made in recent years to use statistical studies of scientific research papers as a means for deriving general statements about trends in science.  For example, there has been a continuing interest in the question of how the frequency of citation of a scientific paper depends on its age.  These investigations have, however, been mainly concerned with the major branches of science only, and have also, perhaps, been rather more interested in identifying past trends than in making specific predictions for the future. Although such results are obviously valuable, it is also important to push these analyses further into smaller areas within a main scientific subject division, since such areas may have significantly different bibliographical properties from the subject average.  One particularly important aspect of such work concerns the origin of new growth areas within a major discipline. We can specifically pose the question: is it possible, purely from a statistical analysis of scientific research papers, to identify the appearance of a new growth area and, if so, how soon after its first appearance can such an area be identified? \", '1274': \"The Structure of Scientific Literatures II: Toward a Macro- and Microstructure for Science Griffith, B.C. Small, H.G. Stonehill, J.A. Dey, S. Part I of this paper described the first steps in mapping the scientific literature, using a new technique - co-citation - to measure the degree of similarity among documents.  The work developed directly from an earlier paper which defined this measure, and explored its relationship to other citation measures for identifying relationships among documents.  We now report the outcome of an attempt to create 'maps' of the scientific literature. The scales of these maps have been systematically manipulated so that they present, not only an overview of all highly-cited papers in natural science, but also a detailed view of a single scientific specialty.  At each level we have systematically sought indications of the validity of the mapping operation, and have indications that the maps display at least certain important aspects of the specialty structure of science. \", '1275': 'College Libraries and Chemical Education Gross, P.L.K. The small college has stood staunch in its desire to supply the liberal education and perhaps it has done well in maintaining this position.  On the other hand, many of the large universities have shifted the emphasis from undergraduate work to graduate study. Still others have tried to develop both side by side. Few of the small colleges have kept astride with the inevitable consequences of such a situation.  The few who have are sending an increasing number of their graduates to these universities to complete their training.  As an example of this, it is the boast of Pomona College that over seventy per cent of her graduates have taken subsequent professional training. It has become the evident duty, therefore, of the small college to prepare its men, not only to enter such graduate schools, but also to meet successfully the ever-increasing intensity of competition found there.  This in addition to supplying a broad cultural education.  This duty has brought with it a number of problems of first magnitude.

In this paper I propose a bibliographic system for science literature that can eliminate the uncritical citation of fraudulent, incomplete, or obsolete data by making it possible for the conscientious scholar to be aware of criticisms of earlier papers.  It is too much to expect a research worker to spend an inordinate amount of time searching for the bibliographic descendants of antecedent papers. It would not be excessive to demand that the thorough scholar check all papers that have cited or criticized such papers, if they could be located quickly.  The citation index makes this check practicable. Even if there were no other use for a citation index than that of minimizing the citation of poor data, the index would be well worth the effort required to compile it. This paper considers the possible utility of a citation index that offers a new approach to subject control of the literature of science.  By virtue of its different construction, it tends to bring together material that would never be collated by the usual subject indexing.  It is best described as an association-of-ideas index, and it gives the reader as much leeway as he requires.  Suggestiveness through association-of-ideas is offered by conventional subject indexes but only within the limits of a particular subject heading.

Since 1868 the number of mathematical publications per year (measured by counts of titles abstracted) has grown from about 800 to 13,000 at an average continuous compound rate of about 2.5 percent per year, doubling about four times a century.  Deviations from the exponential curve are clearly related to war, depression, and recovery.  If the total number of publications prior to 1868 is estimated by extrapolating from the curve of annual output, the cumulative grand total of mathematical titles grows from 41,000 in 1867 to 419,000 by the end of 1965.  Deviations from an exponential growth of 2.5 percent per year are negligible except for two \"pauses\" during world wars, after which the observations continue parallel to the theoretical curve.

Gradually the study began to incorporate calculations of the effects of variable growth on a wide range of scientific concerns: studying, teaching, research, publishing, citations, the basis of scientific prestige, promotions, unemployment.  It became apparent that generally unsuspected forces have a powerful influence on the careers of scientists and everyone else enmeshed in rapid change. This book presents some evidence for change and speculates about many effects.  It also makes a beginning toward understanding the forces that cause and do not cause change.  It may provide some solace for those in dormant fields who have wondered why life has passed them by.  It may, perhaps, make a few highly successful scientists a little more modest.  Most of all it may guide those who still have a choice - and so have we all. ', '1309': \"Science and Information Theory Brillouin, L. A new scientific theory has been born during the last few years, the theory of information.  It immediately attracted a great deal of interest and has expanded very rapidly.  This new theory was initially the result of a very practical and utilitarian discussion of certain basic problems:  How is it possible to define the quantity of information contained in a message or telegram to be transmitted?  How does one measure the amount of information communicated by a system of telegraphic signals?  How does one compare these two qualities and discuss the efficiency for coding devices?  All of these problems, and many similar ones, are of concern to the telecommunication engineer and can now be discussed quantitatively. From these discussions there emerged a new theory of both mathematical and practical character.  This theory is based on probability considerations. Once stated in a precise way, it can be used for many fundamental scientific discussions.  It enables one to solve the problem of Maxwell's demon and to show a very direct connection between information and entropy.  The thermodynamic entropy measures the lack of information about a certain physical system.  Whenever an experiment is performed in the laboratory, it is paid for by an increase of entropy, and a generalized Carnot Principle states that the price paid in increase of entropy must always be larger than the amount of information gained.  Information corresponds to negative entropy, a quantity for which the author coined the word negentropy.  The generalized Carnot Principle may also be called the negentropy principle of information.  This principle imposes a new limitation on physical experiments and is independent of the well-known uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics. \", '1310': 'Two Paradigms for Scientific Knowledge?

We were introduced by Kuhn to the notion of scientific progress as a series of qualitative changes, each involving the overthrow of a prevailing paradigm of thought by a new paradigm which alters the whole perspective of a science. Palermo has appropriately summarized Kuhn's analysis.  It seems, if we judge by constant citations of Kuhn and the references to paradigms, crises and revolutions among scientists and philosophers, that he has induced a novel self-consciousness about the growth of scientific knowledge and the nature of cumulativeness in the expansion of understanding - and not least among psychologists.  This may be in small part (though I doubt it) because one of psychology's concerns is the empirical study of the growth of knowledge: Jean Piaget, whose influence in some quarters has now become so great that he is hailed as a revolutionary in those quarters, has for several decades been developing a theory of the growth of knowledge - or, if you insist, of the development of cognition - which, like Kuhn's account (in his preface Kuhn acknowledges illumination from Piaget), eschews accumulation and posits a sequence of qualitative changes each of which completely reorganizes thinking. \", '1312': 'The Development of Specialities in Science: the Case of X-ray Protein Crystallography Law, J.

The central papers of his latest book argue and elaborate on this theme.  He says: All work in science is work directed towards the growth of objective knowledge.  We are workers who are adding to the growth of objective knowledge as masons work on a cathedral. I will first make some preliminary points about the word 'objective'. This will give substance to issues which are in danger of becoming too rarefied.  Second, I will outline Popper's account of objectivity.  Third, I will argue that despite the value of what he says, his approach is seriously misleading.

It is probably safe to say that the bulk of these systems and programs represent the individual efforts of a small group working at one institution, often operating under a relatively restricted set of research and computing assumptions.

It used to be believed that the results of scientific investigation would lead to continuous progressive improvements in conditions of life; but first the War and then the economic crisis have shown that science can be used as easily for destructive and wasteful purpose, and voices have been raised demanding the cessation of scientific research as the only means of preserving a tolerable civilization.  Scientists themselves, faced with these criticisms, have been forced to consider, effectively for the first time, how the work they are doing is connected with the social and economic developments which are occurring around them.  This book is an attempt to analyze this connection; to investigate how far scientists, individually and collectively, are responsible for this state of affairs, and to suggest what possible steps could be taken which would lead to a fruitful and not to a destructive utilization of science.

In a rough ecological series, we find on one end the forest dwelling West African Species (Mandrillus leucophaneus, M. sphinx, Papio papio), none of which has so far been studied in the field.  The first step into open country is realized by the savanna baboons of South and East Africa, including, from south to north, the species Papio ursinus, cynocephalus and anubis.

During the past three hundred years the journal article has become the main institutionalized form of formal scholarly communication. Potential contributions to a discipline acquire credibility because they have been published in a reputable journal (Zuckerman and Merton, 1971).  Who published what and where therefore becomes a central question in the understanding of scholarly, and in particular scientific, disciplines.  There have recently been a number of investigations concerning the career of such publications.  This career, I suggest, can be conceptualized into three stages. 1) Pre-publication.  Here the scholar writes the article, circulates it to colleagues and perhaps presents it at formal and informal meetings (Garvey, Lin and Nelson, 1971). 2) Publication.  Here the article is submitted to one or more journals for publication consideration (Zuckerman and Merton, 1971). 3) Post-publication.  Here colleagues either ignore the published article or reward it through citations to it in their own work.  The practice of citing a colleague's work is perhaps the main way in which scholars indicate what they consider to be a contribution to their discipline. \", '1336': '\"Exit, voice, and loyalty\": Further reflections and a survey of recent contributions Hirschman, A.O.

The influence of ascribed statuses on the life chances of individuals is being studied in an effort to estimate the \"fairness\" of social institutions in rewarding talent.  Social scientists are trying to determine the extent to which so-called \"irrelevant\" characteristics influence the ways in which people are judged by social institutions and eventually reach social positions in the hierarchies of income, prestige, and influence.  Of the major institutions in American society, science has received perhaps the least systematic attention.  Little is known about how scientists achieve positions of renown.  This book examines several aspects of a single basic question:  is the stratification of individuals in science based upon the quality of scientific performance, or does discrimination obtain in the processes of status attainment? A more technical way of putting the same question would be to ask whether universalistic and rational criteria predominate as the basis for recognition in the social system of science.

I hope, further, that the approach used - even if not the specific conclusions I have drawn from it - may be useful in bridging the gap that seems now to exist between those sociologists who are concerned with society as an entity and who analyze social behavior in terms of its consequences for society as a whole and those sociologists who are concerned first of all with the motives, attitudes, and goals of the individual participants in these patterns of social behavior. My approach hopes to answer the question of why it is that most individuals, most of the time, come to \"want\" to do what it is that society \"needs\" them to do.

By virtue of its peculiar links with the reward system in science, the communication system plays a central part in the maintenance and growth of science.  It is the means by which the individual scientist relates to the social system:  he publishes his work to gain recognition, and reads the publications of others to maintain his knowledge.  The formal communication system also forms the basis for the allocation of rewards: instrumental and consumatory.  Thus it is a means of exercising social control. The informal communication system, although important, is the distaff side.  Its recognition is personal with more immediate and consumatory rewards.  Legitimation of objective or methods of work is rarely given by the social system through informal systems of communication, though it is growing in importance as an information dissemination system.

A general account is presented of the emergence, growth, and decline of scientific research networks and their associated problem areas.. Research networks are seen to pass through three phases.. The first, exploratory phase is distinguished by a lack of effective communication among participants and by the pursuit of imprecisely defined problems.. The second phase is one of rapid growth, associated with increasing social and intellectual integration, made possible by improved communication.. An increasingly precise scientific consensus gradually emerges from a process of negotiation, in which those participants who are members of the scientific elite exert most influence.. But as consensus is achieved the problem area becomes less scientifically fruitful; and as the network grows, career opportunities diminish..

The great men of science stand atop a pyramid of less distinguished and, to a large extent, invisible scientists.. An alternative hypothesis holds that relatively few scientists are responsible for advance in science and that, in the broader historical perspective, most of the eminent scientists, even of the calibre of Nobel laureates and National Academy members of today, are the \"pedestrians\" of history.. This paper attempts to put these conflicting ideas to empirical test for the field of physics.. Three independent sets of data are analyzed:  one is drawn from a stratified random sample of American academic physicists, a second from a subjective evaluation of significant contributions to recent physics, a third from a set of papers cited in The Physical Review.. All three sets of data indicate that there is a sharp stratification in the use of work published by various types of scientists..

The analysis mostly uses multivariate linear regression.. Large and significant correlations with departmental prestige exist for measures of department size, research production, research opportunities, faculty background (including quality of PhD university), and faculty awards and offices.. Combinations of from six to nine indicators of these variables account for about three-fourths of the variance in departmental prestige; when other types of variables are held constant, indicators of all except research opportunities remain significantly associated with departmental prestige.. Correlations of prestige with rates of inbreeding and the proportion of foreign doctorates are discussed.. Differences in the correlates of prestige are small among the four fields studied..

The conclusions:  1) The scientist needs continuous  personal assistance by a librarian or information specialist in order to make effective use of data bases. 2) As local retailer, the librarian has an accordingly important role to play now and in the future, a role at present generally ignored.

The purpose of this paper is to help clarify the concept and discuss it in the context of the librarian\\'s conventional planning and administrative activities.  This is done through a narration of the step-by-step procedures followed in the conceptualization and design of an actual library and information program.  The steps involved are the following:  definition of the purpose of the program, and financial and administrative constraints on its design and operation, as envisaged by management; a user study to determine needs and preferences of the presumed audience of the program; analysis and definition of program performance requirements; selection of methods and mechanisms for implementing performance requirements; conceptualization and documentation of program design; evaluation of design; modification and completion of design. Two basic principles that are discussed and emphasized are the need to define what the program should be doing and what it should not be doing, and the need and means for determining real as opposed to apparent costs in the design process.

The National Science Library is not a library in the conventional sense of the word but rather an information transferral agency. Its activities are designed to provide the Canadian scientific and industrial communities with direct and immediate access to the publications and information required in their day-to-day work.  Through co-operative measures with both national and international information agencies, the NSL serves as the focal point of a national scientific and technical information network.  The Library employs a variety of mechanized techniques to facilitate the storage, retrieval and dissemination of information.  During the past three years it has operated an SDI service using CT and ISI tapes.  In November 1968 this SDI service, which had been limited to meeting the needs of approximately 170 scientists in the Ottawa area, was expanded to provide a national SDI service.  The author describes the evolution of these services from the local to national level, outlines basic techniques, describes the successes and failures of the system and indicates future developments. \", '1363': \"Current Awareness Publications An Evaluation Bloomfield, M. Three types of current awareness publications are defined in terms of their generation and distribution characteristics.  These types are the SDI type, the intermediate type such as NASA's SCAN program, and the unselected type such as the usual library accession list.  A fourth type, the indexing and abstracting journal is defined but not related to the other three types.  The three current awareness publications are shown to have a relationship in terms of the number of requests they can produce from a given set of references or notices.  The SDI system will produce about one request from ten notices; the intermediate type about one request per hundred notices; ad the unselected type, one request per thousand notices.  Despite the differences in the number of notices to generate one request, the cost to produce one request is about the same for the three types of tools.  Also, the usage of these tools is related to the amount of user time available and a curve is presented based on various assumptions to define this relationship. \", '1364': 'The New York Times Information Bank Rothman, J.

An application of location theory to the question of centralized versus decentralized library facilities for a university, with relevance for special libraries is presented.  Locating university libraries near classrooms, offices, and dormitories requires a larger budget than combining these libraries into a centralized facility.  Yet there is a cost to the university community which does not appear in the university budget - a cost in time, energy, and decreased use resulting from locating the library a longer distance from users.

A survey which assessed the impact of the services on the information habits of the university users is also discussed.  Over 97% of the survey respondees indicated that the services had contributed to their professional activities.  Some users reported that the service had been a method of bypassing library reference works; others indicated that the service had brought them back into the  library and made them aware of information sources previously unknown to them.

Comparison shopping between centers is advised as centers differ considerably in the services which are offered,  the data bases which are available, the experience of the information specialists who construct search profiles, pricing structures which are used, and the prices which are charged.

A survey of the information use patterns and communication practices of academic physicists in the  greater Boston area reveals that academic physicists rely heavily on formal and informal sources of information.

The following pages form the concluding portion of four lectures delivered by me in the University of Cambridge as Sandars Reader in Bibliography, 1921. As the two pairs of lectures appeal to widely different classes of the community, I have decided to print them separately, though the underlying theme is the same, viz. the need for uniformity in book classification as a preliminary to co-operative action in library administration and bibliography. Book classification is shelf classification, and shelf classification carried to its furthest limits leads necessarily to uniformity in the extension and definition of its classes.  Add to this a chronological order of books in their classes and your scheme of classification acquires a new value; for it presents for each period a bibliographical counterpart of the corresponding growth of the activities of the human mind. My first two lectures dealt with this thesis in its practical application to library work and the compilation of subject bibliographies.  Here statistical bibliography is considered in relation to the growth of modern civilization. Strictly speaking, the province of statistical bibliography ends with the presentation of the figures compiled.  Their final interpretation should be left to those possessing the necessary qualifications.

The mathematics with which we are concerned is known as the theory of directed graphs, or more briefly as digraph theory.  It deals with abstract configurations called digraphs, which consist of \"points\" and \"directed lines.\"  When these terms are given concrete referents, digraphs serve as mathematical models of empirical structures, and properties of digraphs reflect structural properties of the empirical world.

Those conceptions were ones I had previously drawn partly from scientific training itself and partly from a long-standing avocational interest in the philosophy of science.  Somehow, whatever their pedagogic utility and their abstract plausibility, those notions did not at all fit the enterprise that historical study displayed.  Yet they were and are fundamental to many discussions of science, and their failures of verisimilitude therefore seemed thoroughly worth pursuing.  The result was a drastic shift in my career plans, a shift from physics to history of science and then, gradually, from relatively straightforward historical problems back to the more philosophical concerns that had initially led me to history.

The rapid development of information retrieval methods since the last war - together with the development of systems using mechanical or electromechanical means (punched cards) for such purposes followed later by electronic retrieval (computers) - have led to transformations in the structure of classification or coding systems for books and documents.  Generally speaking, document specialists have tended to elaborate a large number of different codes, usually totally unrelated to each other, each conceived to meet the special documentation requirements of a particular organization.

Subject analysis for information retrieval is an area which always seems deceptively simple to those without previous background in it, however extensive their background in specific subject disciplines may be.  The basic requirement seems easy enough: to structure the statement of a subject in such a way that it can be placed into, and retrieved from, an ordered file. While attempts have been made to use simple, non-complex terms or even single words, it always becomes evident that single words are often insufficient to express a subject, and that some subjects are in themselves complex. To express such subjects requires either that their constituent concepts -- not words -- be separated and then recombined, or that only one part of the subject be shown. The former solution requires that the indexer perform the necessary analysis and synthesis, and then separate the constituents for the searcher to reassemble.  The latter forces the seeker of information to sort through many items to find those bearing on the complex topic he wants, and ma require the indexer to decide under which part(s) of the concept an entry should be made.

These changes coincided with the publication of the results of the Cranfield project, which showed clearly that all indexing languages are basically the same.  However, although it was possible to teach these new approaches, there was no one textbook which covered the subject approach in the way that I felt was needed.  The first edition was intended to fill this gap, and its reception, both in Britain and abroad, showed that it did indeed fulfill a real need.  It met with a very positive welcome from lecturers and - more importantly - from students, particularly in the United States, where British textbooks on classification had previously been regarded with something akin to suspicion.

Rudolf Kaiser sums up the argument between the classed and the dictionary catalog by stating that a library needs both and explaining that the subject index fills the need as far as an alphabetical catalog is concerned.  However, his conclusion misses the mark, since, for one not completely the master of the system of classification, there is no approach to the classed catalog save through an index, yet the index is not in fact as complete and direct a guide to the subject content of the library's collections as an alphabetical catalog rationally and fully cross-referenced. \", '1396': 'Survey of Commercially Available Computer-Readable Bibliographic Data Bases Schneider, John H.

This study deals with syntactic structure both in the broad sense (as opposed to semantics) and the narrow sense (as opposed to phonemics and morphology).  It forms part of an attempt to construct a formalized general theory of linguistic structure and to explore the foundations of such a theory.  The search for rigorous formulation in linguistics has a much more serious motivation than mere concern for logical niceties or the desire to purify well-established methods of linguistic analysis.  Precisely constructed models for linguistic structure can play an important role, both negative and positive, in the process of discovery itself.  By pushing a precise but inadequate formulation to an unacceptable conclusion, we can often expose the exact source of this inadequacy and, consequently, gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic data.  More positively, a formalized theory may automatically provide solutions for many problems other than those for which it was explicitly designed. Obscure and intuition-bound notions can neither lead to absurd conclusions nor provide new and correct ones, and hence they fail to be useful in two important respects.

Few librarians and library educators who criticize research relating to their fields realize in 1972 how far research has progressed during the last decade and a half.  The criticism usually relates to the recognition that librarianship is more of a service and less of a fact- finding field of endeavor and that librarians are primarily trained to assist in the research activities of others rather than to conduct their own.  One can add here that the average librarian who spends about forty hours a week on his job not always has the stamina to spend his free time on original research or the writing of proposals, which either are not adequately funded or are not published with the prominence hoped for.  If the librarian-researcher commits his findings to writing, he is occasionally criticized for writing poorly or for having dwelled on topics of limited interest to the reviewer.  Or he finds that while many praise his work there are no funds, possibilities, or opportunities to translate his conclusions into action.

This is an empirical study of information transfer in the R&D operations of large industrial corporations.. Its basis is a body of survey data collected from 2000 engineers and scientists in 13 establishments of four corporations and from 1200 members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.. The data describe instances in which respondents acquired useful technical information from sources outside their immediate circle of colleagues.. The analysis is descriptive in character, following a functional approach in which the use of various means of information transfer is considered in relation to the purposes of technical work.. While the data, in general, confirm the results of other studies of this sort, they demonstrate also that the relative use of alternative means will vary significantly with the circumstances of their use.. The report explores the association of variations in a number of specific personal, organizational, and technological factors with variations in the use of sources of information.. In a more general interpretation of these findings, those variations are related to aspects of the goals of the work to which the information was applied.. The purposes of technical work are considered along two basic dimensions, one relating to the potential for contribution to the development of some body of systematic knowledge, the other to the support of particular operational objectives.. When the focus of work is on operational goals, local and informal sources account for most instances of information transfer.. Formal and more distant sources are the most common means used when the focus is on \"professional\" goals, i.e., those concerned with contributions to knowledge.. In conclusion, the report discusses the effects which management may have, within an organization, on the process of information transfer, and the need for managers and students of the process to take into account the interplay in this process of personal values, task requisites, and the structure of formal and social groups..

The MARC records provided a search data base for an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty with biweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specified fields of interest.. Of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest in participating, 209 (70 percent) responded affirmatively.. Only 40 participants could be accommodated, so they were chosen in proportion to the number of faculty members in each department or school:  anthropology-l, business-10, economics-3, education-15, government-4, history-4, and sociology-3.. An \"interest\" statement from each faculty member was translated into both Library of Congress classification numbers (e.g., E6ll) and subject heading terms, i.e., elements of discrete heading separated by a comma, dash, parenthesis, or period (e.g., U.S.--HIST.--CIVIL WAR--PRISONERS, EXCHANGE OF becomes six terms:  U/S/HIST/CIVIL WAR/PRISONERS/EXCHANGE OF).. The resulting \"interest profiles\" were recorded on punched cards for computer matching with subject headings and class numbers.. The weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with MARC records.. Each profile was assigned a \"cutoff weight\" or \"hit level\" of 6.. Subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that the sum of weights on matching terms would be equal to, exceed, or be less than the hit level, thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of a particular record.. All class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that a hit would occur on any matching number.. Three computer programs were employed in producing the SDI lists.. Program Extract used MARC Master Tapes as input and extracted the card number (accession number), subject heading terms, and class number for current records; Program Retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those in the profiles and recorded the card numbers for \"hits\"; Program Print compared these card numbers with those on complete MARC records and printed three copies of each record to be sent to the faculty.. One copy was for the faculty member\\'s own use; one was to be evaluated and returned; and one was to be used for making recommendations to the library.. Subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the MARC file mainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record, whereas there is only one class number; and a hit often occurred on a record\\'s second or third heading.. The SDI system performed well in selecting performed well in selecting relevant records, and overall evaluations were highly favorable.. Some 73 percent of notices received by faculty members were for works judged new to the faculty.  The majority felt that the SDI service provided an automatic, regular  notification of new works.. They felt that it usually brought works to their attention quicker than other sources; it informed them of items they otherwise would have missed; it furnished a compact source listing books in all but only their fields; it required very little time; and it provided a convenient means for making library recommendations and therefore increased the amount of recommending done..

To help ease the growing financial burden of housing their collections, many librarians have suggested employment compact storage depositories for little-used materials.. Two aspects to be considered in designing a storage system are: the fraction of the collection which is to be stored; and the criteria to be used for selecting materials for storage.. This study demonstrates that for a given selection criterion least-cost storage quantities can be assessed by balancing the large circulation costs and the small shelving costs associated with stored materials.. Two storage criteria, one based upon the age of the materials and the other utilizing the individual book usage rates, are discussed and compared.. For the age policy the objective is the determination of a least-cost critical age at which materials are transferred to storage and which defines the fraction of the collection that should be stored.. The model assumes that the circulation rate of the books decline with age according to an average geometric pattern of obsolescence.. The average time gap between the most recent circulations of books is utilized as the measure for rate of usage of a book.. The storage decision variable resulting from the minimization of the total cost function of the usage rate policy is a critical intercirculation gap, the maximum amount of time that a book should be permitted to remain in a working collection without being used.. Those books which are stored by the above rule might be those for which the time since last use exceeds the critical intercirculation gap.. Hence, although the least-cost selection rule is independent of the composite distribution of usage rates, the fraction of the collection stored depends upon the circulation activities of the individual libraries.. An empirical evaluation of the storage models was made using data collected from three libraries at Purdue University and estimates of cost parameters extracted from the literature.. Calculations for the least-cost decision rules and the related costs demonstrate that significant savings can be realized from storage of materials, but the calculations indicate that a large portion of the collection must be stored.. Comparisons of the age policy and the usage rate policy indicate that the latter criterion is preferred for all cases examined, including a situation where the usage rate policy is handicapped with a relatively high unit relocation cost.. Sensitivity analyses of the cost parameters for practical ranges of values show that the choice for the length of the planning horizon has a relatively insignificant effect on the decision rules; that changes in the capacity-related cost parameters will cause significant changes in the results; and that the rules are extremely sensitive to changes in the circulation cost differential.. An important component of the latter consideration is a rather subjective estimate for the cost of a service delay, which appears to have a potentially large influence on the decision rules.. ', '1418': 'Journal Usage Patterns and their Implications in the Planning of Library Systems O\\'Neill, Edward True Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research.. Libraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the major responsibility for providing public access to the world\\'s literature.. Most universities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized libraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. This use of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally, resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines.. The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this division of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to examine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and the scattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns.. These results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library systems.. Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually estimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data are developed.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its advantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually made relative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines can be defined in comparable terms.. A \"discipline wheel\" is proposed which can serve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines.. This framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and also for measuring the similarity between two disciplines.. One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study of journal productivity is the concept of \"scattering\" of articles or \"title dispersion\".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has resulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various sources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly the Yule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered.. The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, and evaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use in determining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of adding additional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, and building mathematical models of library systems are among some of the applications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivity functions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as a function of the number of subscriptions it receives.. The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to which the above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data was collected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D. dissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Complete records of the university\\'s scientific journal holdings were also obtained.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally satisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientific disciplines is measured as is the similarity between the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is also measured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system\\'s holdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposed and evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions.. This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts as title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity between disciplines, and others.. The quantification of these concepts leads to a basis for the design and evaluation of complete library systems..

The more critical of these problems involve: degree of automation, flexibility, browsability, storage space, and retrieval time.. A step toward the solution of these problems is presented here along with several demonstrations of feasibility and advantages.. The methodology on which this solution is based is that of a posteriori automatic classification of the document collection.. Feasibility is demonstrated by automatically classifying a file of 50,000 document descriptions.. The advantages of automatic classification are demonstrated by establishing methods for measuring the quality of classification systems and applying these measures to a number of different classification strategies.. By indexing the 50,000 documents by two independent methods, one manual and one automatic, it is shown that these advantages are not dependent upon the indexing method used.. It was found that among those automatic classification algorithms studied, one particular algorithm, CLASFY, consistently outperformed the others.. In addition, it was found that this algorithm produced classifications at least as good, with respect to the measured established in this dissertation, as the a priori, manual classification system currently in use with the aforementioned file.. The actual classification schedules produced by CLASFY in classifying a file of almost 50,000 document descriptions into 265 categories are included as an appendix to this dissertation..

Recognition of the general inadequacy of present indexing, and concern over time and cost factors in index preparation have prompted experimentation in the development and application of machines to assist in the indexing process.  As a result, use of suitable mechanized or partly mechanized procedures to replace or complement the manual indexing process has become more widespread.

The development of the separately housed undergraduate library on the modern university campus is a recent innovation - so recent, in fact, that in September, 1965, there were only six such libraries in the United States. The interest in effective undergraduate education which led to the creation of these libraries, however, is not of such recent origin.  As early as 1608, when Thomas James was appointed to Bodley\\'s Library, \"he proposed the establishment of an undergraduate library to help the younger student.  But Sir Thomas Bodley was opposed.\"  So it is to Harvard that we turn for an example of the protracted concern for the undergraduate\\'s plight. Despite the concern voiced by these earlier writers, most universities and their libraries were relatively small until this century.  More important, they were largely undergraduate institutions.  The great expansion of graduate education is a twentieth-century phenomenon.  The problems of the undergraduate in using university collections were greatly compounded by the striking growth in the size of collections and by an increasing emphasis on the acquisition of materials suitable for research. The large university collections became increasingly difficult for the undergraduate to use.  When he had to select his books from the card catalog and obtain them through paging in a closed-stack system, he might well abandon the attempt before finally locating a book which was not checked out, missing, or at the bindery - and which was suitable for his purposes.  The university library was also difficult to use because it was crowded - study conditions were unsatisfactory and staff was insufficient to handle the volume of work.

Gradually, however, these pioneers of international librarianship began to realize that technical problems were too ambitious for multilateral action and in their discussions the emphasis was placed more on functions and organizations, on the social and even economic achievements of the international library community - which was not fully international at all - were limited to comparisons of national efforts, with some countries constantly over-critical and others overgenerous.  Outstanding bibliographic projects, like the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke, were international in scope, but national in conception. \", '1442': 'The Universal Decimal Classification Foskett, A.C. This study represents the result of some fifteen years of contact with the Universal Decimal Classification, as a user, as a reviser and as a classification teacher.  As a Information Officer at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell, I was concerned with the use of the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC), both as classifier and as user of the resulting catalogues; I was also directly concerned as Liaison Officer for the Atomic Energy Research committee for UDC with the development of the Code of Practice which later became the basis of the Special subject edition for nuclear science and engineering.  With accelerators; this work was carried out along the general lines indicated in this study, and is now part of UDC, which indicates that modern ideas can be accommodated within the scheme without undue strain. ', '1443': \"Universals in Linguistic Theory Fillmore, C.J. We feel that a profound change has occurred in linguistic thinking in the last decade.  It is not longer of any interest to describe one after another language 'anyhow' without regard to the relevance of the facts to general linguistic theory.  As Ross put it, it makes no sense to talk about 'describing a language in terms of its own structure alone.'  Toward the end of the conference, when it had become apparent that the general agreement did not encompass any currently explicitly formulated model, the question was raised:  What should we be teaching our students?  Langendoen's answer seems to us most apt: We should give them the ability to recognize a interesting linguistic problem when they see one, that is, one which throws some light - negative or positive - on our conceptions of what languages in general are like. \", '1444': 'The Case of Citation Data in Writing the History of Science Garfield, E. Can a computer write the history of science?  Probably not in the sense usually implied.  However, the research reported herein is a preliminary attempt to understand and define some basic problems that must be solved if computers are ever to aid the historian of science - no less supplant him. In this study, it was necessary to select a recent important scientific breakthrough which was based on the cumulation of years of diverse scientific achievement.  For this reason we selected the discovery of the DNA code.  For a concise historical description of the events, we then selected \"The Genetic Code,\" a book by Dr. Isaac Asimov which describes the major scientific developments that eventually led to the duplication in the laboratory of the process of protein synthesis under control of DNA. ', '1445': 'User Requirements in Identifying Desired Works in Large Libraries Lipetz, B.A. The work reported here is a study of the utilization of the card catalog of a very large library, specifically the principal catalog of the library system of Yale University. The study was motivated by two basic concerns, one of them of a long-term, or exploratory, nature, the other of a short-term, or operationally supportive, nature.  The long-term concern is the question of how to design a computerized catalog for a very large library that can be expected to give the best possible performance.  The short-term concern is the question of whether, and, of so, how, existing card catalogs in very large libraries may be made more responsive to user requirements.  It was recognized that a carefully designed study of actual utilization of a catalog of a large library could shed useful light in both areas of concern.

At the British Association meeting in Exeter last month, Professor Ziman addressed the section devoted to general topics on the question of how scientific information becomes public knowledge.  The system of communication, he implied, is not as rotten as some like to think. ', '1448': 'Vocabulary Control for Information Retrieval Lancaster, F.W. This book deals with properties of vocabularies for indexing and searching document collections; the construction, organization, display, and maintenance of these vocabularies; and the vocabulary as a factor affecting the performance of retrieval systems.  Most of the text is concerned with vocabularies for post- coordinate retrieval systems, with special emphasis on thesauri and machine-based systems.  Vocabularies for pre-coordinate systems (e.g., alphabetical subject catalogs and classified catalogs) are discussed only briefly to provide historical perspective and for the light they shed on the problems o vocabulary control in general.  This type of vocabulary is well covered in existing texts. ', '1449': 'The Weapons Acquisitition Process: An Economic Analysis Peck, M.J. A distinctive feature of American weapons development and production is the use of private firms to carry forward most of the effort.  This volume is primarily concerned with the government- business relationships within which these activities take place. Our title reflects our emphasis.  Weapons Acquisition is defined to include the conception, development, and production of technically advanced weapons for ultimate use by the armed forces.  Process emphasizes the flow of decisions and activities during weapons programs, including the actions, reactions, and interactions of government agencies and defense contractors.  Economic Analysis indicates our concern with how these activities and relationships affect the quality, time, cost, and value outcomes of weapons programs. The principal objective of this volume is increased knowledge of these facets of weapons development and production.  Such an objective classified the volume as a social science, rather than administrative study.  Yet most social science research, however \"pure\" the form, is ultimately directed at changing public policy.  That is the intention here, but this book does not conclude with a specific set of public policy recommendations.  Rather, it is largely limited to providing understanding - a prerequisite to criticism, debate, revision, and improvement. ', '1450': 'Weeding Library Collections Slote, S.J. This book is based upon two recent research projects in weeding and identifying core collections.  However, it became apparent that the principles and techniques studied are applicable to almost all types of library collections. This work has been designed to be used for four distinct purposes: 1. As a comprehensive source summarizing the opinion, knowledge, and serious research in the field of weeding.  The author\\'s own research is reported in such detail that replication of the studies is possible.  In addition, this book contains the first report of the Harrison study. 2. As a do-it-yourself guide for librarians wishing to weed out their present collections.  It is the aim of this book not only to explain and justify its methods, but to include a step-by-step procedure for \"weeding without tears.\" 3. As a textbook in library schools, especially in courses that deal with the acquisition and maintenance of library collections, for weeding is one of the best techniques available for the long-range building of useful collections. 4. As a stimulus to further study in this entire area.  It is hoped that libraries using the recommended methods will measure and report upon the costs of weeding and the impact of such weeding upon changes in the amount of circulation and in user satisfaction. ', '1451': 'Some Behavioral Patterns of Library Users:  The 80/20 rule Trueswell, R.L. A characteristic of inventory in business or industry is that approximately 80 percent of the number of transactions taken from a warehouse represents about 20 percent of the items stocked.  This may also be considered as a ranking of stock items by their transaction activity which will show that the top 20 percent of the stocked items (i.e., the most active items) account for about 80 percent of the total number of transactions.  The rule is sometimes expressed as the 75/25 rule with the same interpretation. It is only by coincidence that the figures add to 100 as the phenomena relate to the relationships between the two statistical measures. ', '1452': 'The Wiswesser Line-Formula Chemical Notation (WLN) Smith, E.G. The line-formula chemical notation described in this manual is a precise and concise means of expressing the structural formulas of chemical compounds.  Its basic idea is to use letter symbols to denote functional groups and to use numbers to express the lengths of alkyl chains and the sizes of rings. These symbols then are cited in connecting order from one end of the molecule to the other.  For the past hundred years, ever since structural chemistry began, chemists have been using graphic symbols in this way.  This line-formula notation is simply an extension and standardization of this practice. ', '1453': \"Women in Librarianship Myers, M. There are some who question whether the status of women in the library profession is a major issue.  A survey of library literature, however shows an increase in the factual data available regarding differences between men and women in salaries, promotional patterns and other professional situations. There are local library groups which are examining the status of women in their own libraries and organizing to improve their employment situations.  On the state and national level, conference programs and workshops at library association meetings have dealt with various aspects of sex discrimination, affirmative action policies, sexism in children's materials and the like. \", '1454': 'Work and Motivation Vroom, V.H. The basic plan for this book was evolved during the summer of 1959. At that time I was working on a chapter entitled \"Industrial Social Psychology\" for the annual Review of Psychology.  I was impressed by the large amount of research being conducted in the field, but found the task of integrating that research and of identifying the progress made during the period of the review exceedingly difficult.  In part, this difficulty was a result of the great differences among investigators in the phenomena they selected for study and the methods they used to study it.  A more troublesome problem, however, was the apparent theoretical implications of their research.  Concepts tended to be highly specific and inadequately defined.  There was little standardization of terminology and little consideration for the nature of the processes underlying empirical data. ', '1455': 'Work and the Nature of Man Herzberg, F. Work and the Nature of Man is the third book of a trilogy concerning job attitudes.  In the first book, Job Attitudes: Review of Research and Opinion, my colleagues and I attempted to review and systematize what had been gleaned from research and contemplation after a half-century of effort.  In the Motivation to Work that followed, we described an original research study that offered a completely new hypothesis about the way people feel about their jobs.  In this book, I have taken that hypothesis and expanded it to a general theory of Work and the Nature of Man.\\tWhile the trilogy contains the three basic stages of scientific inquiry, knowledge of what has gone before, new research and finally a theory, the task that I set out for myself many years ago, upon graduation for the School of Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh, is just beginning. That task was to give original substance to the new discipline of Industrial Mental Health and, if possible, to make some positive contributions. ', '1456': 'World Dynamics Forrester, J.W. Over the last several decades interest in economic development, population growth, and the world environment has expanded rapidly. As world-wide stresses have increased, many individuals and organizations have begun to study and to influence the changing aspects of the world situation.  But it seems fair to observe that most of the activity has been addressed to separate facets of the world system.  Little has yet been done to show how the many actions and forces are affecting one another to produce the total consequences that we observe.  Now however, many persons are coming to believe that the interactions within the whole are more important than the sum of the separate parts.  This book was undertaken as one step toward showing how the behavior of the world system results from mutual interplay between its demographic, industrial, and agricultural subsystems. ', '1457': 'World Trends in Library Education Bramley, G. One of the most significant aspects of the evolution of librarianship in the twentieth century has been the emergence of the library schools as a potent factor in shaping new philosophies and new attitudes in the library profession.  The intention of the present work is to examine some of the implications of this rapid growth in the number of library schools, noting current trends and possible changes in the future.  Inevitably, some limitations have had to be imposed, and there has been a deliberate concentration upon Anglo- American library education, while at the same time examining other major patterns of professional education for librarians which exist in the world, and comparing these with the approach  of the English speaking countries.  An attempt has been made to trace the influences which the British and America systems of library education have had, particularly in the developing countries. ', '1458': 'Legal Restrictions on Exploitation of the Patent Monopoly: An Economic Analysis Baxter, W.A. The patent laws confer on a patentee power to exclude all others from making, using or selling his invention.  In furtherance of a constitutionally recognized goal - \"To promote the Progress of Science and the useful Arts\" - Congress has thus adopted a constitutionally authorized means - \"securing...to Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective...Discoveries.\"  The constitutional clause is remarkable in several respects.  Its recognition of the possibility that invention might require encouragement implies not only that technological innovation is desirable but also that, but for legal subsidization, the quantity of innovation forthcoming would or might be less than optimum. This recognition, coming on the morn of an era during which the tendency of a free market to achieve optimality in all activities was greatly and religiously overestimated, prompts brief inquiry into the soundness of the supposition. ', '1459': 'Language and Thought Poluskin, V.A. This book considers the basic aspects of this complex problem - the historical and social essence of language and thought, their interaction in historical evolution, the essence of linguistic meaning in relation to the content side of thought, and the physiological mechanism of the processes of abstraction, generalization, etc. ', '1460': \"Modern Integral Information Systems for Chemistry and Chemical Technology Chernyi, A.I. At the present time, about 15% of all the world publications of scientific and technical literature relate to chemistry and chemical technology.  Each year throughout the world more than 250,000 documents are published:  journal papers, specifications for authors' certificates and patents, scientific and technical reports, monographs, etc., and in the last twenty years the number of such documents has increased by an average of 9% a year.  In these scientific documents information on 100-150 thousand new chemical compounds is published. \"}\n"

            "Use Made of Technical Libraries Slater, M. This report is an analysis of 6300 acts of use in 104 technical libraries in the United Kingdom. Library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern of information use.  Information transfer in libraries is restricted to the use of documents.  It takes no account of documents used outside the library, still less of information transferred orally from person to person.  The library acts as a channel in only a proportion of the situations in which information is transferred. Taking technical information transfer as a whole, there is no doubt that this proportion is not the major one.  There are users of technical information - particularly in technology rather than science - who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on desk collections of handbooks, current periodicals and personal contact with their colleagues and with people in other organizations.  Even regular library users also receive information in other ways. \n"

            "18 Editions of the Dewey Decimal Classifications Comaromi, J.P. The present study is a history of the DEWEY Decimal Classification.  The first edition of the DDC was published in 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editions will continue to appear as needed.  In spite of the DDC's long and healthy life, however, its full story has never been told.  There have been biographies of Dewey that briefly describe his system, but this is the first attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that more than any other has spurred the growth of librarianship in this country and abroad. \n"
